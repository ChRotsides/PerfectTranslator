(The Greek text listed the titles of short stories, so I translated them into English.)""She stood next to the window and looked absorbedly at a gray cat walking on a gray fence in a gray yard. Tomorrow would be Christmas and she had only $1.87 to buy a gift for Jim. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. Always the unexpected. Only $1.87 to buy a gift for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling - something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim. There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art. Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length. Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy. So now Della's beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.""She put on her old brown jacket, put on her old brown hat. With a whirl of her skirt, and the radiant sparkle still in her eyes, she rushed out the door and down the stairs to the street.

There where the sign read: "Madame Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds." One flight up Dell sat down before the mirror of her dressing table and began to remove the combs and pins from her hair. The mirror was old and blotchy, reflecting a warm and kindly light into the room...Twenty dollars," said Madame, lifting the mass with a practiced hand.""If Jim doesn't kill me," she said to herself, "before the liar looks at me for a second time, he will say that I look like a dancer from Connie Island. But what could I do - oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?

At seven o'clock the coffee was ready and the frying pan was on the back of the stove, hot and ready to cook the chops.

Jim never arrived late. Della doubled the chain in the locket and sat down at the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stairs, far away, on the first floor, and for a moment she turned white. She had the habit of saying small silent prayers for the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered, "Please, God, make him think that I am still beautiful."

The door opened and Jim walked in and closed it.

"Did you cut your hair?" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he hadn't yet arrived at this invented event, even after the hardest mental work.

"She cut it and sold it," said Della.""You don't need to look," said Della, "They're sold, I tell you, sold and gone. It's Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Perhaps the hairs of my head were numbered," she went on with sudden serious sweetness, "but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?"

From the ecstasy of his joy, Jim seemed to have waked up the echoes sleeping in the room. 

...

For there lay The Combs – the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jewelled rims – just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.

...

"But my hair grows so fast, Jim!"

And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, "Oh, oh!" 

Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly on her open palm.""The dull precious metal seemed to flicker with the reflection of the bright and fiery spirit. Isn't it wonderful, Jim? I chased all over town to find it. Now you'll have to look at the clock a hundred times a day. You'll regret your watch. I want to see how it looks on it. Instead of obeying, Jim collapsed onto the couch, buckled his belts beneath the back of his head, and smiled. "Della," he said, "let's put our Christmas gifts aside and keep them for a while. They're too nice to use now. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now let's suppose you put the chops on. The wise men, as you know, were wise men - extremely wise men - who brought gifts to the Child in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas gifts. They were wise men, and their gifts were wise ones. Everywhere they are the wisest. They are the Magi. A cosmopolitan sat at one of the empty chairs and I was glad. The coffeehouse was full of people at noon. By chance, the small table I was sitting at had escaped the view of the incoming customers, and two empty chairs stretched out their hands with corrupt hospitality to the influx of customers. I invite you to think about the scene - the marble tables, the leather seats on the wall, the happy company, the ladies dressed in semi-state dresses, who speak in a superbly visible choir of taste, economy, luxury, or art, the quiet and generous waiters, the music that serves everyone with wisdom.""With its raids on composers - the mixture of conversation and laughter - and, if you like, the Würzburger in tall glass cups that bend on your lips like a ripe cherry sways on the branch of a thief's cherub. A sculptor from Mauch Chunk told me that the scene was truly Parisian. My cosmopolitan was named E Rushmore Coglan and we'll hear him next summer at Coney Island. He is going to create a new "attraction" there, he informed me, offering a long distraction. And then his conversation ran along the parallels of latitude and longitude. He cooked the great, round world in his hand, let's say, familiarly, contemptuously, and it did not appear larger than the seed of a cherry Maraschino on a table grape fruit. He spoke disrespectfully of the equator, slipped from continent to continent, ridiculed the coasts, wiped the open seas with his towel. With a wave of his hand, Iris talked about a specific bazaar in Hyderabad. Whiff! You'd be skiing in Lapland. Zip! Now you were riding the waves with the Kanakas in Kealailufifilö. Presto! He dragged you through a swamp with oak trees in Arkansas, left you to dry on the alkaline plains of his ranch in Ayntacho, and then put you in the society of Viennese archdukes. Immediately after, he would tell you about a cold he contracted in Buenos Ayres and how old Eskamila cured it with a warm infusion of chuchula grass. You would have addressed the letter to "E Rushmore Coglan, Esq, Earth, Solar System, Universe," and you would have mailed it, feeling certain that it would be delivered to him. I was sure that I had finally found the only true cosmopolitan after Adam, and I listened to his world speech, fearing that I would discover the local note of the simple world policeman in him. However, his views were never disturbed or fell apart - he was as impartial about cities, countries, and continents as the winds or gravity. And as E Rushmore Coglan chatted about this little planet, I thought fondly of a great almost cosmopolitan who wrote about the whole world and dedicated himself to Mumbai.""In one of his poems he must say that there is pride and competition among "all the cities of the earth" and that "people from these cities, walk around, but stick to the corners of their cities like a child on its mother's dress". And whenever they walk on "unknown streets", they remember their city "most faithful, foolish, tender, making its name, which breathes, bond upon their bond". And my joy revived because I caught Mr. Kipling sleeping. Here I found a man who was not made of clay - someone who had not boasted narrowly about his birthplace or country, someone who, if he boasted at all, would boast about his whole round globe before the Aryan and the inhabitants of the Moon."

Expression on these topics collapsed in front of E Rush - more Coglan from the third corner of our table. While Coglan described to me the topography along the Trans-Siberian Railway, the orchestra slipped into a medley. The final air was "Dixie" and as the notes of exhilarae-B fell outward, they were almost drowned out by a loud applause from almost every table.

It is worth a paragraph to say that this remarkable scene can be watched every night in many cafes in the City of New York. Several whiskies have been consumed to explain it with theories. Some speculated hastily that all Southerners in the city go to cafes at dusk. Its applause for the "revolutionary" air in a northern city is a little worrying, but not insurmountable.""The evening was the time when the stock was dying down. One of us mentioned to the waiter three Würzburgers - the dark-haired young man acknowledged his inclusion in the order with a smile and a nod. I didn't ask him a question because I wanted to try out a theory I had. "Would it bother you to tell me," I began, "if you're from E. Rasmor Coglan's Fist hit the table and shook me into silence. "Excuse me," he said, "but that's a question I never like to hear. What does it matter where a man is from? Is it fair to judge a man by the postmark on his letter? Because, I've seen Kentuckians who hated whiskey, Virginians who weren't descended from Pocahontas, Indians who didn't write novels, Mexicans who didn't wear velvet pants with silver dollars sewn on the seams, funny Englishmen, spendthrift Yankees, cold-blooded Southerners, narrow-minded Westerners, and New Yorkers who were too busy to stop and watch one of those one-man bands on the street corners. Let a man be a man and don't handicap him with the label of any section." I know the South, and when the band plays "Dixie" I like to observe. I have established the belief that the man who applauds this air with special violence and apparent sectional feeling is most likely a native of either Secaucus, NJ, or the area between Murray Hill Grammar School and the Harlem River, this city. I was ready to put my opinion to the test by asking this gentleman when you interrupted with your - larger theory, I must confess" And now the dark-haired young man spoke to me and it became clear that his mind was also moving in his own alleyways. "I would like to be a periwinkle," he said mysteriously, "at the top of a v£ley, and to sing coo-ral]oo-ra1loo."""They are waiting for me in slippers at a teahouse in Shanghai, and I don't need to tell ERN how to cook my eggs in Rio de Janeiro or Seattle. The world is very small. What's the point of boasting about being from the North or the South, or from the old mansion in Dale, or from Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, or from Pike's Peak, or from Fairfax County, or from Hollywood Flats or anywhere else? The world will become more beautiful when we stop being foolish about a moldy city or ten acres of marsh land just because we happen to be there.""My cosmopolitan friend gave me a big goodbye and left me, thinking he saw someone through the smoke and thorns of his cigarette. So I stayed with the aspiring vine grower, who was limited to Würzburg without further ability to express his aspiration, sitting melodic on the top of a valley. 

I sat pondering my obvious cosmopolitan friend and wondered how the poet had managed to lose him. It was my discovery and I believed in him. How did it happen? - "The people born of them, they tt-traffic up and down, but cling to the hem of their cities, like a child to its mother's dress. Noc so E Rushmore Coglan With the whole world for himself - My musings were interrupted by a terrible noise and a collision in another part of the café. I saw above the heads of the seated patrons E Rushmore Coglan and a stranger to me engaging in a fierce battle. They fought between the tables like Titans, and glasses were broken, and men grabbed their hats high and fell down, and a brunette screamed, and a blonde began to sing "reas-My cosmopolitan friend maintained the pride and reputation of the Earth, when the waiters closed both fighters with the famous flying wedge formation and took them out, continuing to resist. I called McCanhy, one of the French gnrpsnr, and asked him the reason for the collision. "The man with the red tie" (that was my cosmopolitan friend), he said, "got hot because of what the other said about the useless sidewalks and the water supply from where he came." "But," I said, astonished, "this man is a citizen of the world - a cosmopolitan." "He came from Mattawamkeag, Elaine," McCarthy continued, "and he wouldn't tolerate being hit on the door.""
