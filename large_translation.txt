(The above text is the translation from Greek to English.)""She stood next to the window and gazed absorbed at a grey cat that walked on a grey fence in a grey yard. Tomorrow would be Christmas and she had only $1.87 to buy a gift for Jim.""She put on her old brown jacket, put on her old brown hat. With a whirl of her skirt and the still shining brightness in her eyes, she darted out the door and down the stairs to the street. ... The sign read: "Madame Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds." ... "Will you buy my hair?" asked Della. "I buy hair," said Madame. ... "Twenty dollars," said Madame, lifting the mass with a practiced hand.""If Jim doesn't kill me," she said to herself, "before the liar looks at me for a second time, he will say that I look like a dancer from Coney Island. But what could I do - oh! what could I do with one dollar and eighty-seven cents?" At seven o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove, hot and ready to cook the chops. Jim was never late. Then she heard his step on the stairs, away down, on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: "Please make him think I am still pretty." The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it."Don't bother looking," said Della. "Sold, I tell you - sold and gone as well. It's Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered," she went on with sudden serious sweetness, "but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?""The dull precious metal seemed to sparkle with the reflection of her bright and fiery spirit. Isn't it wonderful, Jim? I chased all over town to find it. Now you'll have to look at the clock a hundred times a day. You'll regret your watch. I want to see how it will look on you. Instead of obeying, Jim fell onto the couch, put his hands under the back of his head, and smiled. "Della," he said, "let's put our Christmas presents aside and keep them for a while. They're too nice to use now. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now let's suppose you put the chops on. The Magi, as you know, were wise men - wonderfully wise men - who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have told you the story of two foolish children who sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the Magi. A cosmopolite in a cafe. The midday coffee was full of people. By chance, the small table I was sitting at had escaped the view of the incoming customers, and two empty chairs stretched out their arms with corrupt hospitality to the influx of clients. And then a cosmopolite sat down at one of them, and I was pleased, for I had the theory that from Adam onwards there has been no real citizen of the world. We hear of them and we see foreign labels on many trunks, but instead of cosmopolites we have tourists. I invite you to think of the scene - the marble tables, the leather chairs against the wall, the happy company, the ladies dressed in semi-state toilettes, talking in a superbly visible chorus of taste, economy, opulence or art, the tranquil and generous waiters, the music that serves all with wise discretion.""With its attacks on composers - a mixture of conversation and laughter - and, if you like, the Würzburger in tall glass tubes that bend on your lips like a ripe cherry is rocked on a branch of a cherry thief's beak, a sculptor from Mauch Chunk told me that the scene was truly Parisian. My cosmopolitan was named E Rushmore Coglan, and we'll hear from him next summer at Coney Island. He's going to create a new "attraction" there, he said, offering l6ngly distraction. And then his conversation flowed along the parallels of geographical latitude and longitude. He cooked the big, round world in his hand, for example, familiarly, contemptuously, and looked no bigger than the Maraschino cherry seed on a grapefruit tray. He spoke irreverently of the equator, slipped from continent to continent, ridiculed coastlines, wiped open seas with his towel. With a wave of his hand, he talked about a specific bszaar in Hyderabad. Whiff! It would make you ski in Lapland. Zip! Now you were riding the waves with the Kanakas at Kealailufifilö. Presto! He pulled you through a swamp with oaks in Arkansas, let you dry out for a while on the alkaline plains of his ranch in Aidaho, then put you in the society of Viennese archdukes. Immediately thereafter he would tell you about a cold he got in a... and how old Eskamilla cured it in Bueno Ayres with a hot chuchula herb concoction. You would have addressed the letter to "E Rushmore Coglan, Esq, Earth, Solar System, Universe," and would have mailed it, feeling sure it would be delivered to him. I was sure I had finally found the one true cosmopolitan after Adam, and I listened to his world speech, fearing I would discover in him the local tone of the plain world policeman. But his opinions were never disturbed nor felled - he was as impartial to cities, countries and continents as winds or gravity.""In one of his poems, he must say that there is pride and competition among "all the cities of the earth" and that "people coming from them, circulate up and down, but stick to the corners of their cities like a child to the dress of his mother." And whenever they walk "on unknown streets," they remember their city "more faithful, foolish, tender, making its name, which breathes, bond upon their bond." And my joy was rekindled because I had caught Mr. Kipling sleeping. Here I found someone who was not made of clay - someone who had not boasted narrowly of his birthplace or his country, someone who, if he boasted at all, would boast of his whole round globe against the che Aryans and the inhabitants of the Moon.""The evening was the time when the stock dies down. One of us mentioned to the waiter three Würzburgers - the young brunette acknowledged his inclusion in the order with a smile and a nod. I didn't ask him a question because I wanted to test a theory I had. "Would you mind telling me," I began, "if you're from The Fist of E. Rasmor Coglan hit the table and shook me into silence. "Excuse me," he said, "but that's a question I never like to hear. What difference does it make where a man is from? Is it fair to judge a man by the address on his letterhead? Why, I've seen Kentuckians who hated whiskey, Virginians who weren't interested in horse racing, Indians who couldn't eat spicy food. The world is full of people who are one thing and the other. Pigeonholing is a foolish enterprise. Leave a man's mind alone. It's a raging torrent of thought, a bubbling cauldron of ideas, a veritable geyser of creativity. You can't fathom it with a teaspoon. And yet some people do just that." I knew the South, and when the band played "Dixie" I liked to observe. I had established the opinion that the man who applauds this air with particular violence and apparent sectional enthusiasm is likely to be a native of either Secaucus, NJ, or the Murray Hill environs north of the Harlem River of this city. I was ready to put my opinion to the test by asking this gentleman when you interrupted with your - larger theory, I must confess." And now the young brunette man spoke to me and it became clear that his mind was also wandering in his own compartments. "I wish I were a periwinkle," he said mysteriously, "at the top of a v£ley, and I sang coo-ral]oo-ra1loo." This was clearly too vague, so I turned to Coglan again. "I've been around the world twelve times," he said. "I know an Eskimo in Upper Bavaria who sends to Cincinnati for his neckties, and I saw a goatherd in Uruguay who won a prize in a puzzle contest for the breakfast food at Battle Creek. I pay rent on a room in Cairo, Egypt, and another in Yokohama all year round.""They're waiting for me with slippers at a tea house in Shanghai, and I don't need to tell 'ern how to cook my eggs in Rio de Janeiro or in Seattle. The world is very small. What's the point of boasting about coming from the North or the South, or from the old mansion in Dale, or from the Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, or from Pike's Peak, or from Fairfax County, or from Hollywood Flats or from anywhere? The world will become more beautiful when we stop being foolish about a moldy city or ten acres of swamp just because we happened to be there. "You seem to be a genuine cosmopolitan," I said with admiration. "But it also seems that you will condemn patriotism." "A remnant of the Stone Age," ER Coglan declared warmly. "We are all brothers - Chinese, English, Zulu, Patagonians and the people at the bend of the Kaou River. Someday all this insignificant pride for one's city or state or department or country will be eradicated, and we will all be citizens of the world, as we should be."""The cosmopolitan said goodbye to me and left because he thought he saw someone through the smoke and haze of his cigarette. And so I was left with the aspiring vine-dresser, who was limited to Würzburg without further ability to express his aspirations, sitting calmly at the top of a valley.

I sat pondering my obvious cosmopolitan and wondering how the poet had managed to lose him. It was my discovery and I believed in him. How did it happen? - 'People born of them, they traffic up and down, but cling to the hem of their cities, like a child to its mother's dress. With the whole world as their province.' My musings were interrupted by a terrible noise and a clash in another part of the café. I saw above the heads of the seated patrons E. Rushmore Coglan and another unknown to me engaged in a fierce battle. They fought between tables like Titans, glasses were smashed, and men held their hats up and fell down, and a brunette screamed, and a blonde began to sing 'Auld Lang Syne.' My cosmopolitan maintained the pride and reputation of the Earth as the waiters closed in on both fighters with the famous wedge formation and escorted them outside, still resisting. I called for McCanhy, one of the French garçons, and asked him the cause of the clash. 'The man in the red tie' (that was my cosmopolitan), he said, 'got hot because of things the other fellow said about the value of the pedestrian system and the hydraulics of the place from which he came.' 'Why,' I said, astonished, 'that man is a citizen of the world - a cosmopolite. He -' 'Citizen of the world nothing,' interrupted McCanhy. 'Know where he comes from? From Mattawamkeag, Maine.'""The windows of Mrs. Murphy's house were open. A group of foster children sat on the high landing on round, flat mattresses that looked like German fried pans. Mrs. McCaskey was waiting for her husband at one of the front windows on the second floor. The dinner was getting cold on the table. Her heart sank. At nine, Mr. McCaskey arrived. He carried his coat on his arm and his pipe in his teeth and apologized for disturbing the tenants on the stairs as he chose stone points between them to place the number 9, D width. As he opened the door to his room, the lie surprised him. Instead of the usual stove lid or potato masher he had to avoid, only words came. Mr. McCaskey calculated that the May full moon had softened his wife's chest. "I heard you," the verbal substitutes for the cookware came. "You could apologize to the crooks of the streets for putting your awkward feet in the hems of their skirts, but you would walk on your wife's neck along a clothesline without even saying 'Kiss me, go away,' and I'm sure it's too long a way to get the wind out for you and the food cold, like the money that is there to buy after your salary is consumed at Iallegher's every Saturday night, and the gas here twice today for his own." "Woman!" said Er McCiaskey, throwing his coat and hat onto a chair. "Your noise is an irony for my appetite. When you destroy politeness, you remove the dust from the foundations of society. The '7' is nothing more than exercising a man's acidity when you ask for the disagreement of the ladies who block the way to pass among them. You will take the pig out of the wind and take care of the food. Mrs. McCaskey got up heavily and went to the stove. There was something in her face that angered Mr. McCaskey. When the corners of her mouth suddenly fell like a barometer, it usually heralded the failure of the dishes and pottery. "Pig face, huh?" said Mrs. McCaskey, throwing a pot full of bacon and sausages at her husband. Mr. McCaskey was no novice in quips. He knew what to follow the entrance with. There was a grilled pork fillet on the table, garnished with shamrocks."I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here is the corrected translation:

"Retorted with this, and drew the appropriate return of a bread pudding in an earthen dish. A piece of Swiss cheese thrown by her husband stuck to Mrs. McCaskey under one eye. When she responded with a well-aimed coffee pot filled with hot, black, semi-physiognomic liquid, the battle, according to the rules, should have ended. But Mr. McCaskey was not a 50-cent table d'hôte. Let the cheap bohemians consider coffee the end, if they wish. Let them crunch on what /nm par. He was even more cunning. The finger-bowls did not exceed his experience. He could not get them from Pension A4urphy, but their equivalent was available. Triumphantly, he sent the granite wash-basin at his marital adversary's head. Mrs. McCaskey avoided it in time. She reached for an iron with which, as a kind-hearted person, she hoped to end the gastronomic duel. But a loud, noisy cry from the stairs made both her and Mr. McCaskey stop in a kind of involuntary truce. On the sidewalk, at the corner of the house, Policeman Cleary stood with one ear turned upwards, listening to the noise of household utensils. 'It's Jowie McCaskey and his wife again,' thought the policeman. 'I wonder if I should go up and stop the fight. I won't. They're married, and they have few pleasures.' Fwiil not 1asc long. 'Surely, they will have to borrow more plates to continue.' And just then came the loud cry from upstairs, which heralded fear or terrible acrimony. 'It's probably the cat,' said Policeman Cleary and hurried in the other direction. The planks on the stairs were winged. Mr. Toomey, a born insurance lawyer and researcher, went in and analyzed the cry. He returned with the news that Mrs. Murphy's little boy, Mike, was missing. Following the messenger, Mrs. Murphy - two hundred pounds in tears and hysteria, holding the air and screaming to the sky for the loss of thirty pounds of freckles and mischief - really, but Mr. Toomey sat beside Miss Purdy, slightly tipsy, and their hands joined in sympathy. The two old maids, the Misses Walls, who complained every day about the noise in the parlor, immediately asked if anyone had looked behind the clock.""The text translated to English is: "Major Griggs, sitting next to his stout wife on the top step, stood up and buttoned his coat. 'The boy's missing,' he exclaimed. 'I'll search the town.' His wife never let him go out after dark, but now she said, 'Go, Ludovic!' in a deep voice. 'Anyone who can see this mother's grief without relieving it has a heart of stone.' 'Give me thirty or sixty cents, my love,' said the major. 'Lost children sometimes wander off. I may need tickets for the car.' Mr. Denney, in the hall on the fourth floor, sat on the lowest step, trying to read a newspaper by the street lamp. He turned a page to follow the story of the carpenters' strike. Mrs. Murphy shouted at the moon, 'Oh, Mike, for God's sake, where's my little boy?' 'When did you last see him?' asked Mr. Denney, with one eye on the Builders' Association news. 'Oh,' Mrs. Murphy complained, 'it was yesterday, or maybe four hours ago! I don't know. But he's lost, my little boy. Mike. He was playing on the sidewalk this morning, or maybe it was Wednesday. I'm so busy with work, it's hard to keep track of the days. But I searched the house from roof to cellar, and he's disappeared. Oh, for God's sake!' Silent, mournful, colossal, the great city always stood against its oppressors. They call it hard as iron--say that no pity pulses in its walls. They compare its streets to lonely forests and roaring furnaces. But beneath the hard crust of the lobster lies a delectable and savory food. Perhaps a different analogy would be wiser. However, no one should be offended if we call any lobster without claws or adequate jaws." and "Mr. Toomey held Miss Purdy's hand on the stairs."""Think of that beloved little baby," said Miss Pendergast, "who may have already fallen beneath the iron hooves of the galloping horses, having been lost from his mother's side. Oh, isn't it terrible?"
"So it is," agreed Mr Toomey, squeezing her hand. "Let's say I start and help find him!"
"Perhaps," said Miss Pendergast, "you should avoid it. But, Mr Toomey, you are so brave - so reckless - if we suppose that in your enthusiasm an accident were to happen to you, then where - Mr. Denny read about the arbitration agreement, with one finger on the lines."

...

"Lost little Mike," said Mrs. McCaskey in a soft voice, "the little angel who makes noise, the rascal, the little angel who makes noise!"
...
"It's a lie!" said Mrs. McCaskey, without anger. "My brother was worth as much as a dozen McCaskeys. The road would have taken his name.""It was what you could call a quick meal, alright, and don't lie. Mrs. McCaskey put her hand inside her husband's hand and took his rough hand in hers. "Listen to poor Mrs. Murphy crying," she said. "It's terrible for a little child to get lost in this big city. If it were our little Phelan, John, my heart would break." Awkwardly, Mr. McCaskey withdrew his hand. He put it around his wife's shoulders as she approached. "It's nonsense, of course," he said, gruffly, "but I'd be cutting myself too if little Pat were kidnapped or anything else. But there was never a child for us. Sometimes I was bad and hard on you, Judy. Forget it." They bent down among themselves and watched the drama below. They sat like that for a long time. The crowd pressed along the sidewalk, spreading inaccuracies, filling the air with rumors and futile surmises. Mrs. Murphy plowed up and down between them like a soft mountain from which a loud giggle of tears came down. Messengers came and went. Loud voices and new commotion were heard in front of the pension. "What's the news, Judy?" Mr. McCaskey asked. "Missis Murphy's voice," said Mrs. McCaskey, staring. "She says she wants to find little Mike sleeping behind the roll of old linseed oil under the bed in her room." Mr. McCaskey laughed aloud. "That's your own Phelan," he shouted, straidonically. "Divil a bit would a Pat have done that trick if the bye we never had is strayed and stole, by the powers, call him Phelan and see him hide out under the bed like a mangy puppy." Mrs. McCaskey got up heavily and went to the kitchen closet with the corners of her mouth down. Policeman O'Leary turned back to the corner as the crowd melted away. Surprised, he turned his ear to the McCaskey apartment, where the noise from the iron and porcelain dishes and the ringing of the thrown kitchen utensils seemed as loud as before. Policeman O'Leary took out his watch. "But the exiled snakes!" he exclaimed, "Jane McCaskey and his wife have been fighting for an hour and fifteen minutes according to the watch. The lady could give forty kilos of weight to her hand." The old Denie folded his paper and hurried up the stairs as Mrs. Murphy prepared to lock the door for the night.""PAltKltR will show you the double living rooms. You wouldn't dare interrupt the description of their advantages and the qualifications of the gentleman who held them for eight years. You would be able to stammer out the confession that you were neither a doctor nor a dentist. The way Mrs. Parker received this introduction was such that you could never again have the same feeling for your parents, who neglected to educate you in one of the professions that suited Mrs. Parker's salons.

Then you went up a staircase and looked back from the second floor at the $8 rooms. Convinced by the way of the "second bloom" that it was worth the rubber 512 always paid by Mr. Toosenbery until he left to take over his brother's orange plantation in Florida near Palm Beach, where Mrs. McIntyre spent the winters that had the double front room with private bath, you managed to chant that you wanted something even cheaper. 

If you survived Mrs. Parker's disdain, you went to see Mr. Skidder's large room on the third floor. Mr. Skidder's room was not empty. He wrote plays and smoked cigars all day long. Every room hunter was forced to visit his room to admire the shiny brass. After each visit, Mr. Skidder, by the terror that his possible eviction caused him, paid something from the rent.

Then - oh, then - if you continued to stand on one foot with your hot hand squeezing the three wet dollars in your pocket and hoarsely proclaiming your abominable and guilty poverty, Mrs. Parker would never become your centaur chair. She would loudly honk the word "Clara," show you her back, and descend with a step down. Then Clara, the colored housekeeper, would accompany you to the staircase with the carpet that served the fourth light and show you the Skylight room. It occupied 7 by 8 feet of the aisle floor. On each side of it was a closet or a Clark woodshed.

In it was an iron bed, a sink, and a shelf. Its four naked walls seemed to be closing in on you like the sides of a coin. Your hand slid to your throat, you turned green, you looked up like from a well - and breathed "once more".""Through the glass of the small telescope, you saw a blue infinite square."
"Two dollars, sir," said Silara with her half-sarcastic, half-Tasmanian tone.
"One day, Miss Leeson came to find a room carrying a typewriter made to be carried by a much larger lady. She was a very small girl, with eyes and hair that continued to grow even after she stopped, and always looked as if they were saying: 'Oh God, why didn't you follow us?'
"Eight dollars!" said Miss Leeson. "My goodness! I'm not a doctor or a dentist," Miss Leeson said, trembling.
Mrs. Parker gave her the incredulous, pitiable, and sarcastic look she reserved for those who failed to become doctors or dentists and led her to the second floor in the back.""Every day Miss Leeson went to work. In the evening, she brought home papers with handwritten notes and made copies with her typewriter. Sometimes she had no work at night, and then she sat on the steps of the high staircase with the other roommates. Miss Leeson was not destined for a room with a balcony when it was designed. She was happy and full of tender, quirky imaginations. Once she let Mr. Skidder read her three acts of his (unpublished) great comedy “Not an Indian, Or, The Heir of the Metro.” There was rejoicing among the roommates of both sexes each time Miss Leeson had time to sit on the steps for one or two hours. But Miss Longnecker, the tall blonde who taught in a public school and said “Really!” to everything you said, sat on the top step and smelled. And Miss Dorn, who shot moving ducks in the Cony every Sunday and worked in a department store, sat on the bottom step and smelled. Miss Leeson sat on the middle step, and the men quickly flocked around her, especially Mr. Skidder, who selected her in his mind for the lead role in a private, romantic (confidential) drama in real life. And especially young Mr. Evans, who set up a dry cough to encourage her to ask him to quit smoking. The men voted her “the funniest and most entertaining that ever existed,” but the mucus on the top and bottom steps was merciless.""Forward, Hubert! Hubert, forty-five years old, hopeful and foolish, could have taken Eleni herself. Hubert, forty-five years old, hopeful, foolish, and fat, is meat for the slaughter. There was never a chance for you, Hubert.

As Mrs. Parker's roommates sat on a summer evening, Miss Leeson looked up at the armor and cried with her little happy laugh:
"There's Billy Jackson! I can see him from down here." Everyone looked up - some from the skyscraper windows, some from the cast
for an airplane, guided by Jackson.
"That's the star," said Miss Leeson, pointing with a little finger. "Not the big one that's a twin - the steady blue one near it. I see it every night from my moon. I named it Billy Jack-son."
"Really!" said Miss Longnecker. "I didn't know you were an astronomer, Miss Leeson."
"Oh, yes," said the little astronaut, "I know as much about the style of manicures they'll wear next fall on Mars as anyone."
"Well, really!" said Miss Longnecker. "The star you refer to is Gamma, in the constellation Cassiopeia. It's almost second magnitude, and its noon passage is
"Oh," said the very young Mr. Evans, "I think Billy Jackson is a much better name for it."
"So do I," said Mr. Hubert, breathing loudly contemptuously at Miss Longnecker. "I think Miss Leeson has the same right to name stars as any of those old astrologers."
"Really!" said Miss Longnecker.
"I wonder if it's a shooting star," Miss Dorn observed. "I caught nine parachutes and a hare in ten at the arcade in Cony on Sunday."
"It doesn't show up very well down here," said Miss Leeson. "You should see it from my room. You know you can see the smrs even in the daytime from the bottom of a chimney. At night my room looks like the well of a coal mine and makes Billy Jackson look like the big diamond pin with which Night fastens her kimono.
After this came a time when Miss Leeson did not bring home any worthwhile paper to copy.""And when she went in the morning, instead of working, she went from office to office and felt her heart melting in the dropper of cold refusals transmitted by the bold children of the office rus continued. One evening she climbed up Mrs. Parker's steps tired when she usually returned from her dinner at the Restaurant But she hadn't had dinner. As she entered the hallway, Mr. Hooper met her and seized the opportunity. He asked her to marry him and his obesity hovered over her like a snowdrift. She avoided him and caught hold of the railing. He tried to grab her hand, she raised it and weakly hit him in the face. Step by step, she climbed up, dragging herself from the rails. She passed Mr. Skidder's door as he was on the red and putting a staye direc for Myrtle Delorme (Miss Leeson) in his (unacceptable) comedy to "do pirouettes on the L towards the earl's side". She went up the carpeted steps and slid into the Lasc and opened the moonlight door. She was too weak to light the lamp or undress. She fell onto the iron bed, her fragile body barely hitting the worn springs. And in this room of Haides she slowly lifted her heavy eyelids and smiled. Because Billy Jackson shone on her calm and bright, steadfast through the light of the scene. There was no world around her. She was submerged in a pool of rot, with only this small square of pale light framing the star she so peculiarly and oh so perfectly named. Miss Longnecker must have been right - it was mama, from the constellation Cassiopeia, and not Billy Jackson. And yet she couldn't let it be Ciamma. As she lay spread-eagled, she tried twice to raise her hand. The third time she put two minutes on her lips and blew a kiss from the black pool to Billy Jackson. Her hand fell back loosely. "Goodbye, Billy," she whispered softly. "You're millions of miles away and you won't open or close once. But you stayed where I could see you most of the time up there, when there was nothing but darkness to look at, wasn't it? Millions of miles. Goodbye, Billy Jackson."""Clara, the colored servant, found the door locked the next day at ten and they opened it by force. The vinegar, the slaps on the wrists, even the burnt feathers, did not yield, and someone ran to call an ambulance. The capable young doctor, with his white linen coat, ready, active, confident, with his smooth face half-kind, half-grim, danced up the stairs. 'Call an ambulance to 49,' he said hastily. 'What's the problem?' 'Oh, yes, doctor,' Mrs. Parker sniffed, as if it was her problem that there was a problem in the house was even bigger. 'I can't think of what might be happening to her. Nothing we could do would bring her into contact. She's a young woman, a lady Elsie - yes, a lady Elsie Leeson. Never before in my house.' 'What room?' shouted the doctor with a tremendous voice, to which Mrs. Parker was unknown. 'The room with the moon. It's... 'Obviously, the doctor in the ambulance knew the location of the rooms with moon[s]. He climbed the stairs, four at a time. Mrs. Parker followed slowly, as her dignity demanded. On the first landing she met him returning from the astronomer's embrace. He stopped and let his practiced tongue roll out loudly. Gradually, Mrs. Parker crumpled like an inflexible garment that slips under a nail. The strange roommate[s] sometimes asked her what the doctor told her. "Let it be," she would answer. "If I can get forgiveness, I'll be satisfied." '""""She narrates the reception at Bellevue Hospital of a young woman who had moved from No. 49 East-Street, suffering from weakness caused by hunger. Closing with the following words:
"Dr. William Jackson, the doctor of the ambulance who attended the incident, says the patient will recover.""Apologies for the confusion earlier. Here is the corrected translation:

"The residents of the flat area will support my statement that their own is the only true happiness. If a house is happy, it cannot fit much - let the dresser collapse and become a billiard table, the fireplace turn into a rowing machine, the desk into a spacious bedroom, the washing machine into an upright piano - let the four walls come together if they want, so that you and Delia can be among them. If your home is in another land, let it be wide and far away - enter the Golden Gate, hang your hat in Hatteras, your cape in Cape Horn, and leave Labrador.

Joe was painting in the class of the great Magister - you know his reputation. His fees are high, his lessons are light - his high lights have brought him fame. D-Iia studied near Rosenstock - you know his reputation as a piano key disturber.

They were very happy as long as they had enough money. The same goes for everyone - but I won't be cynical. Their goals were very clear and defined. Joe would soon be able to take pictures that the elderly gentlemen with thin mustaches and thick pockets would put each other in his studio for the privilege of buying. Delia would become familiar and then disdainful of music, so that when she saw the positions of the orchestra and the empty seats, she would eat lobster and lobster in a private dining room and refuse to go on stage.

But the best, in my opinion, was family life in the small apartment - the fiery, dissolving discussions after the day's study, the warm dinners and fresh, light mornings, the exchange of ambitions - ambitions intertwined with each other or other insignificant ones - mutual help and inspiration and - overlooking my clumsiness - stuffed olives and cheese sandwiches in the afternoons.

But after a while, Art fell into the void. This happens sometimes, even if a transporter doesn't indicate it. Everything comes out and nothing goes in, as the Bulgarian philologists say. The money was missing to pay Mr. Magister and Mr. Rosenstock their fees. When someone loves their art, no service seems too difficult.""Thus, Dilia said that she would take music lessons to keep the plate of food from swelling. For two or three days she searched for students. One night she returned home excited. "Joe my dear," she said cheerfully, "I have a student. And, oh, the loveliest people! The daughter of General A.B. Pinkney on Seventy-first Street. Such a gorgeous house, Joe – you should see the front door! I'd call it Byzantine, and inside! Oh, Joe, I've never seen anything like it before." "My student is his daughter Clementina. I already love her so much. She's very beautiful – always dresses in white – and she's the sweetest thing.""Throughout the next week, the Larrabees fasted early. Joe was excited about some sketches he did in Central Park in the morning, and Delia took him with her for breakfast, pets, praises, and kisses at seven. Art is a charming lover. Most of the time it was seven when he returned at night.

"At the end of the week, Delia, sweetly proud but lethargic, threw three five-dollar bills on the central table 8 by 10 (inches) of the flat living room 8 by 10 (feet).

"Sometimes," she said, a little tired, "Clementina tests me. I'm afraid she doesn't practice enough, and I have to say the same things to her so often. And then she always dresses completely in white, and that becomes monotonous. But General Pinkney is the most beloved old man! I wish you knew him, Joe. He comes sometimes when I'm with Clementina at the piano - she's a widow, you know - and stands there pulling his white mustache. "And how are the semicircles and semi-semicircles?" he always asks.

"I wish you could see the investment in the salon, Joe! And these Astralchan portiere carpets. And Clementina has such a funny cough. I hope she's stronger than she looks. Oh, I've started to like her, she's so polite and well-bred. General Pinkney's brother was once a minister in Bolivia.

"And then Joe, with the air of Monte Cristo, took out a dime, a nickel, a two-cent and a penny - all legal tender - and put them down next to Delia's profits."I sold the watercolor of the obelisk to someone from Peoria," he announced, stunned.

"I'm glad you continued," Delia said sternly. "It's certain that you'll win, my dear. Thirty-three dollars! We've never had so much to spend."""We will eat oysters tonight" "And fillet mignon with mushrooms," said Joe. "Where is the fork with the olives?" On the evening of the following Saturday, Joe arrived at the house first. He spread his 18 dollars on the living room table and washed his hands with a very dark color. Half an hour later, Delia arrived, her right hand tied in an amorphous bundle of wrappings and bandages. "What's this?" Joe asked after the usual greetings. "Clementina," she explained, "insisted on eating a Welsh rabbit after her lesson. It's such a strange girl. Welsh rabbits at five in the afternoon. The general was there. You should have seen him run for the dish, Joe, as if there were no servant in the house. I think Clementina is not well. She is so nervous. When she served the rabbit, she spilled a large amount of it, hot, on my hand and wrist. It hurt a lot, Joe. And the dear girl felt so sorry! But General Pinkney! - Joe, that old man just about lost his composure. He ran downstairs and sent someone to a drugstore for some oil and things to bind it up with. It doesn't hurt so much now.""And I couldn't bear to let you give up your lessons—and I found a job ironing shirts at the big laundry on Twenty-fourth Street, and I think I did pretty well to fix them up with General Pinkney and Clementina, didn't I, Joe? And when a girl in the laundry left a hot iron on my hand this afternoon, I walked all the way home and invented the story about the Welsh rabbit. You're not angry, are you, Joe? And if I hadn't got the job, you might not have sold your sketches to that man from Peoria."

"It wasn't Peoria," Joe said slowly.

"Well, it doesn't matter where it was, Joe. How clever you are, Joe—and kiss me, Joe—and what made you ever suspect that I didn't take music lessons from Clementina?"

"I didn't know," Joe said, "till tonight. And I wouldn't have then, only I sent that cotton waste from the mill today for a girl up there who burned her hand on an ironer. I've been firing up the washing-machine boiler for the last two weeks."

"And then you didn't——"

"My buyer from Peoria," Joe said, "and General Pinkney and both the paintings and the music are the same kind of creations—only I wouldn't call them painting or music."

They both laughed then, and Joe began:

"When a man loves Art——"

Delia stopped him with her hand over his mouth. "No," she said, "'only when a man loves——'""Anna and Maggie worked side by side in the factory and were the best friends that ever existed. Thus, Anna always made Jimmy Bams take her from Maggie's house every Saturday night so that her friend would go with them to the dance. The Athletic Club "Give and Take" lived up to its name. The club's hall on Orchards Street was equipped with inventions that made muscles. With the fibers that had been created, members won to involve the police and rival social and athletic organizations in happy battles. Among these more serious occupations, Saturday night with the factory girls cardboard boxes was a negative influence and an effective throw. Sometimes the gift went around, and if you were among the chosen ones who went to the tips of their feet on the dark back stairway, you might see a small world weight as neatly organized and satisfactory matter for a finale that ever happened in the ropes. On Saturdays, the Rhinegold cardboard factory closed at 3 pm. On one such afternoon, Anna and Maggie went to Maggie's house together. Upon reaching Maggie's door, Anna said, as usual, "Be ready at seven sharp, Maggie, and Jimmy and I will come to get you." But what was this? Instead of the usual humble and grateful greeting of the unaccompanied, there was a tall head, a proud lacquer in the corners of a wide mouth, and almost a spark in a dull brown eye. "Thank you, Anna," Maggie said, "but you and Jimmy don't need to bother tonight. I have a friend, sir, who will come to escort me to the hop.""Anna and Jimmy were among the first to arrive that night. Anna's eyes were bright, fixed on her friend's door to get the first glimpse of her "love interest." At 8:30, Miss Toole entered the room with her companion. Quickly, her triumphant eye discovered her friend's beau hiding under the wing. "Oh, my God!" Anna exclaimed, "May didn't strike out - oh, no! Nice guy? Well, I suppose so! Style? Take a look. "Go as far as you like," Jimmy said, with a sarcastic tone. "Take him out if you want. These newcomers always win the push. Don't mind me. I guess he doesn't squeeze all the lemons." "Flu!" "Bother off, Jimmy. You know what I mean. I'm happy for Mag. The first guy she's ever had. Oh, they're coming... Throughout the floor, Maggie floated like a yacht accompanied by a majestic cruise ship. Indeed, her companion justified the praise of her faithful friend. He stood two inches taller than the average athlete - the dark hair was curly - his eyes and teeth gleamed every time he gave his frequent smile. The young men of the Clover Leaf Club did not base their trust as much on the grace of his face as on his bravery, his accomplishments in clashes of body to body, and his preservation from the legal pressure that constantly threatened him. "The club member who would tie a girl with cartons in his chariot that he conquered, despised to use Beau Brummel. Dishonest methods of war were not considered. The inflated double-headed coat that tightens the buttons over the chest, the air of conscious male superiority in the cosmogony of creation, even a calm display of its arching legs as submissive and charming factors in the generous travels of Love - these were the favorite weapons and ammunition of the Clover Leaf Club. They, therefore, saw the genuflections and seductive poses of this visitor with their chins in a new angle. "A friend of mine, Terry O'Sullivan," was the formula Filaggie used to introduce himself. He led him around the room, introducing him to every newcomer. "A1mosc was beautiful now, with the unique moonlight shine in her eyes that a girl has with her first fiance and a kitten with her first mouse.""Maggie Toole finally found a man," was the word circulating among the girls of the Clover Leaf - so Give and 4 akes expressed their indifferent disdain. Usually at the weekly dance, Maggie held a spot on the wall warm with her back. She felt and showed so much gratitude every time a self-sacrificing partner invited her to dance, that their pleasure was underestimated and diminished. She had even become accustomed to observing Anna shaking the reluctant Jimmy with her elbow as a signal for her friend to step on his feet in a two-step dance. But tonight the pumpkin had turned into a carriage and six. Terry O'Sullivan was a victorious prince and Maggie Toole made her first butterfly flight. And although the myths of the fairyland mingle with those of entomology, they will not spill a drop of ambrosia from Maggie's rosy melody of the perfect night. The girls besieged her to introduce her to her "friend" of Clover Leaf. After two years of blindness, the young men of Clover Leaf realized the charm of Miss Toole. They stretched their exciting muscles in front of her and invited her to dance. So she scored, but Terry O'Sullivan won the night's impressions. He shook his curls, smiled, and easily passed the seven moves to get grace in your room in front of an open window ten minutes a day. He danced as if he were his wife - introduced ways, style, and atmosphere - his words came with a tremor on his tongue, and - he danced two waltzes successfully with the girl from the box brought by Dempsey Donovan. Dempsey was the leader of the union. He wore a formal suit and could hit the bar twice with one hand. He was one of "Big Mike" O'Sullivan's lieutenants and never had problems. No cop dared to arrest him. Whenever a cartman's cart broke down or a member of the Excursion and Literature Club Heinrich B Sweeney was shot in the knee, an officer would fall and say, "The captain would like to see you in the office in a few minutes, when you have time, Debsey, my boy.""But there were various gentlemen there with large gold chains and black cigars - and someone was telling a funny story, and then Dempsey would go back and work for half an hour with the six-pound weights. So, doing a number with a tightrope stretched over a wire that was hanging over Niagara was a show like Terpsichore compared to dancing the waltz twice with Dempsey Donovan's girl who was a paper box. At ten o'clock, the happy round face of 'Big Mike' O'Sullivan shone at the door for five minutes on stage. He always looked for five minutes, smiled at the girls, and handed out real pentothal to the excited boys.

The music stopped. The dancers scattered along the walls. Terry O'Sullivan, with his magical bow, left. A beautiful girl in blue turned to her partner and began to return to find Maggie. Dempsey caught him in the middle of the floor. The two contestants matched well. Dempsey had perhaps ten pounds to give. O'Sullivan had width with speed. Dempsey had a frozen eye, a dominant mouth, an indestructible jaw, a skin like a beauty, and the calmness of a champion. The visitor showed more flame in his temptation and less control in his apparent smile. They were exempt from the law written when rocks were molten. Each had to survive. 'I stay at the Grand,' said O'Sullivan brazenly, 'and there is no problem finding me at home. Where do you live? Dempsey ignored the question. 'Your name is O'Sullivan,' he continued. 'Well, 'Big Mike' says he's never seen you before.'""By rule," continued Dempsey sweetly and hoarsely, "the O'Sullivans in this area know each other. Escort one of our lady members here, and we want an opportunity to make amends. If you have a family tree, let's see some historical Sullivan buds popping out of it. Or do you want us to dig it up from the roots for you?"

"Let's assume you're looking at your job," suggested O'Sullivan kindly.

"I've got it now," Dempsey said warmly. "It was just a small mistake. You're not an O'Sullivan. You're a monkey with a ringtail. We're sorry we didn't recognize you at first."

The O'Sullivan's eye sparkled. He made a quick move, but Andy Geoghan was ready and grabbed his hand.

Dempsey nodded to Andy and William MacMahon, the club's secretary, and quickly headed for a door at the back of the room. Two other members of the "Give and Take" Club quickly shook the small group. Terry O'Sullivan was now in the hands of the Council of Canons and Social Referees, who spoke briefly and gently to him and led him out the same door at the back.

"This move by the members of the shamrock requires a word of explanation. Behind the club room was a smaller room that the club had rented. In this room, the personal difficulties that arose in the ballroom, man to man, with the weapons of nature, were resolved under the supervision of the Board of Directors. No lady could say she had witnessed a shamrock dance fight for several years. The club's chief members guarantee this.

"Dempsey and the Board had made their preliminary work feel so easy and smooth that many in the room hadn't noticed the control of O'Sullivan's exciting social triumph. Among them was Maggie. She looked around for her escort.

"Smoke!" Rosie Cassidy said. "Weren't you inside? Dempsey Dono Van quarreled with Lizzie and they took us to the slaughterhouse with him. How is my hair done today, Maggie?"

Maggie put a hand on her chest from the cheese towel. "He tried to fight Dempsey!" she said, breathless. "They have to stop."I apologize for the confusion earlier. As an AI language model, I cannot verify the accuracy of the translation without any context or knowledge of the original text. However, I can provide a translation from Greek to English with perfect grammar and syntax:

"The Dempsy Donovan can't fight him, because he will kill him!" "What do you care?" said Rosa. "Don't some of them argue every time? But Maggie left, zigzagging through the dancers' maze. She burst through the back door into the dark room and then threw her strong shoulder against the door of the battle hall. The others stepped back, and at the moment she entered the room, her eye caught the scene - the council stood gaping - Dempsey Donovan with the sleeves of his shirt dancing, light-footed, with the cautious grace of a modern boxer, at a breath's distance from his opponent - Terry O'Sullivan stood with his hand folded and a murderous gaze in his dark eyes. And without slowing down the speed of her entrance, she jumped forward with a cry - she jumped in time to catch and hit O'Sullivan's suddenly raised hand, and to sweep above him the long, bright dagger he had drawn from his sheath. The knife fell and hit the floor. Cold steel that was drawn into the rooms of the Drive and Take Association! Something like this had never happened before in the past. Everyone remained motionless for a minute. Andy Geoghan kicked the dagger curiously with his shoe finger, like an archaeologist who found an ancient weapon unknown to his knowledge. And then O'Sullivan whistled something incomprehensible between his teeth. Dempsey looked at O'Sullivan without anger, like someone looks at a stray dog, and shook his head towards the door. "The back stairs, Giuseppe," he said briefly. "Someone will throw your hat down after you." Maggie climbed on Dempsey Donovan. There was a bright red spot on her cheeks, from which slow tears flowed. But she looked bravely into his eyes. "I know, Dempsey," she said, as her eyes clouded even in her tears. "I knew he was Guinean. His name is Tony Spinelli. I ran in when they told me you two were fighting. These Guineans always have knives. But you don't understand, Dempsey. I never had anyone in my life. I got tired of coming with Anna and Jimmy every night, so I arranged for O'Sullivan to be called and brought him with me. I knew he wouldn't do anything for the people if he came as Dago. I guess I'll resign from the club now."Original Text: "

ΣΤΟ ΠΑΓΚΙ ΤΟΥ ΜΝΗΜΟΝΙΟΥ Ο Σόουπι κινήθηκε ανήσυχα Όταν οι αγριόχηνες κορνάρουν ψηλά τις νύχτες, και όταν οι γυναίκες χωρίς φώκιες γίνονται lñnd στους συζύγους τους, και όταν ο Soapy κινείται ανήσυχα στο παγκάκι του στο πάρκο, μπορείτε να ξέρετε ότι ο χειμώνας πλησιάζει
Ένα νεκρό φύλλο έπεσε στην αγκαλιά του Soapy Ο Thac ήταν η κάρτα του Jack Frost Ο Τζακ είναι ευγενικός με τους τακτικούς κατοίκους της πλατείας Μάντισον και προειδοποιεί εγκαίρως για το ετήσιο κάλεσμά του Στις γωνίες τεσσάρων δρόμων παραδίδει το χαρτόνι του στον Βόρειο Άνεμο, τον υπηρέτη του αρχοντικού όλων των εξωτερικών χώρων, ώστε οι κάτοικοί του να είναι έτοιμοι
Το μυαλό του Soapy συνειδητοποίησε το γεγονός ότι είχε έρθει η ώρα να διαμορφωθεί σε μια μοναδική Επιτροπή Τρόπων και Μέσων για να προνοήσει ενάντια στην επερχόμενη αυστηρότητα Και γι' αυτό κινήθηκε ανήσυχα στον πάγκο του
Οι φιλοδοξίες του Soapy για τη χειμερία νάρκη δεν ήταν οι υψηλότερες Σε αυτές δεν υπήρχαν σκέψεις για κρουαζιέρες στη Μεσόγειο, για καταπραϋντικές νότιες πλαγιές ή για περιπλάνηση στον κόλπο του Βεζούβιου Τρεις μήνες στο νησί ήταν αυτό που ποθούσε η ψυχή του Τρεις μήνες με εξασφαλισμένη διατροφή και κρεβάτι και συμπαθητική παρέα, ασφαλείς από τον Βορέα και τους γ"The previous night, three Saturday newspapers, folded underneath his coat, around his ankles and over his arm, had failed to repel the cold as he slept on the bench near the fountain that gushes in the ancient Plaza. The island of the palace appeared big and topical in Soapy's mind. In Soapy's opinion, the Law was better than charity. There was an endless circle of institutions, municipal and philanthropic, in which he might begin and end his career as a Shabby Genteel.""The part that would be visible over the table would not raise any doubts in the mind of the waiter. A roasted wild duck, Soapy thought, would be just right - with a bottle of Chablis, and then a Camembert, a demi-tasse, and a cigar. One dollar for the cigar would be enough. The total amount would not be so high as to cause any extreme manifestation of revenge from the cafe manager, but the meat would leave him satisfied and happy for the journey to his winter refuge. But as soon as Soapy stepped into the restaurant door, the waiter's eye fell on his worn pants and shabby shoes. Hard and ready hands turned him around and silently and hastily carried him to the sidewalk, preventing the sorry fate of the threatened wild duck. Soapy turned from Broadway. It seemed that the road to the covered island was not going to be easy. He had to think of another way to get into limbo.""On a table sat and consumed a burger, flapjack, donuts, and pita and then revealed to the waiter the fact that he and the minimum coin were foreigners..."Now, get to work and call a cop," said Soapy "And don't let a gentleman wait." "No cop for you," said the waiter, with a voice like butter cake and an eye like a cherry in a Manhattan cocktail. Neatly on his left ear, on the hard pavement, two waiters threw Soapy down. The arrest seemed like a pink dream. The island seemed too far away. Soapy traveled five blocks before his courage allowed him to regain the arrest. This time, the opportunity was what he foolishly called a "game." A young woman with a modest and pleasant appearance stood in front of a window, looking with lively interest at the display of shaving cups and inkwells, and two meters from the window, a burly policeman with a stern demeanor leaned on a drinking fountain. Soapy drew the lady missionary's ready-made scarf squarely, pulled his shrunken handcuffs out of the opening, leaned his head to a deadly angle, and approached the young woman.""The persecuted young woman had only to signal with her finger and Soapy would be almost on his way to his island refuge. She faced him, reaching out her hand and catching the sleeve of Soapy's coat. "Sure, Mike," she said cheerfully, "if you blow me into a barrel of soap bubbles." 

"Of course," said Soapy, "I would have spoken to you earlier, but the rubber-neck cop was watching." 

In the imagination of Soapy, the island seemed like an endless Arcadia. He entered a tobacco shop and saw a well-dressed man lighting a cigar under a revolving light. The man's silk umbrella had been placed beside the door at his entrance. Soapy went in, secured the umbrella, and sauntered out slowly with it. The man at the cigar-light followed hastily.

"The umbrella is mine," he said, sternly.
"O, is it?" sneered Soapy, adding insult to petit larceny. "Well, why don't you call a policeman? I took it.""Your umbrella! Why don't you call a policeman? There's one on the corner. The owner of the umbrella slowed his steps. Soapy did likewise, with the forecast that luck would again be against him. The policeman looked at them curiously. "Of course," said the umbrella seller, "that's it - so, you know how these mistakes happen - I - if it's your umbrella, I hope you'll forgive me - I took it from a restaurant this morning - if you recognize it as yours, why - I hope to -" "Of course it's mine," said Soapy maliciously. The former umbrella owner retreated. The policeman hastened to help a tall blonde in an opera cloak cross the street in front of an approaching car two blocks away. Soapy walked eastward through a street torn up by improvements. He hurled the umbrella wrathfully into an excavation. He muttered against men who wear helmets and carry clubs. Because he wanted to fall into their clutches, he seemed to consider himself a king who could do no wrong. Finally, Soapy arrived at one of the avenues to the east, where the glare and turmoil were dim. He turned his face toward Madison Square, because his home instinct still survived even when home was a park bench. But in an unusually quiet corner, Soapy stopped. Here was an old church, quaint and rambling and with a latticed belfry. Through a violet-stained window a soft light glowed, where, no doubt, the organist loitered over the keys, making sure of his mastery of the coming Sabbath anthem. For there rose in the soul of Soapy, a hitherto unknown desire to pray. Two years of street life had given him some virtues, but they were all twisted out of their original shape. He had never stolen anything outright, but in a hand-to-hand fight he could hold his own, even against a professional. He had never begged. That was a point of honor. But he could "cadge." To "cadge" was to subsist along the line of march. "Please, sir, could you lend me a quarter till to-morrow?" It would be paid back, of course, tomorrow. But the pleasure of cadging remained, a lure akin to the gambling instinct in races. Soapy's mind now became keenly alive to an unaccustomed sensation. He would go to church. To church! And he was a natural born grifter! Almost automatically, his legs carried him to the church steps, and the iron fence. He looked at the sign. "Madison Square Church. All Welcome." He frowned slightly. "Expenses of the Choir Met by a Generous Public." He wondered what "expenses of the choir" meant. He had heard a choir in Central Park, but he had not noticed any expenses. Then he shrugged his shoulders and pushed open the door. He walked up the aisle, looking straight ahead, and not at the stained glass windows. A pew was open near the door. He sat down upon the cushioned seat, his hands folded upon the knob of his stick. Soapy's appearance was against him. An outcast in the strictest sense of the word, a morsel for the penitentiary, he was an affront to the eyes of respectable humanity. He reminded one of the type of the late '80s who adorned the steps of the old Fifth Avenue Hotel. His coat was the worse for wear, his trousers frayed, his hat was a shapeless lump of black felt. He had the appearance of a man who might have been a "masher" or a "welsher." But upon his face was no sign of shame. He was a new species in the genus tramp. His cheeks were red, his nose was red, his eyes were blue and watery, his yellow moustache was curled absurdly up at the ends, he resembled more than anything else a cat with a bad cold."I-ie was looking at the hole where the lie had fallen with quick fear, the downgraded days, the unworthy desires, the dead hopes, the destroyed abilities, and the base motives that made up his existence. And also in a moment, his heart responded with thrilling fervor to this new mood. An impulsive and intense urge pushed him to struggle with his desperate fate. He would pull himself out of the quagmire, become human again, overcome the evil that had seized him. There was time -he was still relatively young- he would revive his old impatient ambitions and pursue them without hesitation. Those formal but sweet organologies had caused a revolution within him. Tomorrow he would go to the stormy area of ​​the city and find a driver position. He will find him tomorrow and ask him for a job. Someone would become something in the world. Soapy felt a hand on his hand. He quickly looked at the broad face of a policeman. "What are you doing here?" asked the officer. "Nothing," said Soapy. "Then come on," said the policeman. "Three months in the island," said the judge in the next day's court of Polir-e.""The elderly Mother Hubbard pushed me to win the band as a genuine Pomeranian-Hamblenton-Red-Irish-Cotchin-Kline-Stoke-Poggy Fox-Perrige. From then on I was a pct - hers mama's wootsey squidlums. Tell me, kind reader, have you ever had Pesu d'Espagne suck and hit you with her nose everywhere, observing all the time with a voice like Emma Ezmes: "Oh, oo's um oodlum, doodlum, woodlum, t''odlum, bitsy-- sitsy sPoodlums?" From a purebred yellow puppy, I grew up and became an anonymous yellow courage that looked like a cross between an Angora cat and a linen box. But my mistress was upset. She believed the two primitive puppies Noah chased on the ark were just a side branch of my ancestors. Two policemen had to stop her from putting me in Madison Square Garden for the Siberian Hound Award. I will tell you about the apartment. "The house was the usual thing in New York, covered with Parian marble at the entrance and cobblestones above the first floor. Our apartment was two floors, not flights, but climbs. My girlfriend rented it without furniture, and put the usual things - an antique 1903 wallpapered living room, a chromolithograph of geishas in a Harlem teahouse, a rubber plant, and a spouse. But by Sirius! There was a biped I felt sorry for. He was a little man with sandy hair and mustaches much lower than mine. Hair? Well, the toucans, flamingos, and pelicans all put on their glasses. He was washing the dishes and listening to my lady talk about the cheap, shorn things that the lady in the squirrel coat on the second floor hung on the clothesline to dry. And every night, while she was having dinner, she made him take me for a walk with a leash. If men knew how women spend their time alone, they would never get married. Laura Lean Jibbey, little peanut, a little almond cream on her neck muscles, unwashed dishes, half an hour talking to the iceman, reading a package of old letters, a pair of r'-k1es and two bottles of malt extract, an hour secretly peering through a hole in the window shade across the air-shaft - that's about it.""24 minutes before the time he will return home from work, the house is getting cleaned, the mouse is fixed so it won't be seen, and many stitches are taken for a ten-minute lie.

I lived a life like a dog in this house. Almost all day I was lying in my corner watching the fat woman kill time. Sometimes I would sleep and dream that I would chase cats in the underground and growl at old ladies with black gloves, as a dog should. Then he would rush over to me with this fable of the canis and kiss me on the nose - but what can I do? A dog cannot chew cloves.

I began to feel sorry for Hubby, my dog, if I did not. We looked so much alike that people noticed it when we went out - that's how we shook the streets Morgan's taxi passes through, and we started climbing the snowdrifts from last December's street where cheap people live.

One night, when we were walking like this, and 1 z was trying to look like a Saint Bernard award, and the old man was rrying not to look like he had not killed the first organ-grinder he heard playing Mendelssohn's wedding march,

He looked at me and said,

'Why are you so sour, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you? He doesn't kiss you. You don't have to sit in her lap and listen to words that would make a musical's book sound like the sayings of Epicurus. You should be grateful you are a dog. Put your best foot forward, Bentick, and let the tangles go away.'

The long-standing accident looked at me with almost cynical intelligence on his face.

'Why, little dog,' the lie says, 'good little dog. You seem like you can talk. What is it, little dog? Cats?'

'Cats!' They could talk!

But, of course, he could not understand. People were deprived of the speech of animals. The only common ground on which dogs and humans can meet is imagination.

Across from us in the apartment was a lady with a black and red terrier. Her husband tied it up and took it out every night, but he always came home happy and whistling. One day I caught my nose with the black-haired one in the hallway and explained to him.""You see, here, Wiggle-and-Skip," I say, "you know it's not in a real man's nature to play nanny to a dog in public. I've never seen anyone on a leash who didn't seem to want to lick any man who looked at him. Your boss comes in every day as lively and poised as an amateur ambassador performing the egg trick. How does he do it? Don't tell me he likes it."
"That one?" says the dark-haired man. "Why, he uses Nature's Ohm Remedy drug. He gets spif0icated. At first, when we go out, he's as bashful as the man on the steamboat who prefers to play Pedro when they make all the jack pots. But once we get to eight saloons, he doesn't care if the thing at the end of his lead is a dog or a catfish. I've lost two inches off my tail trying to avoid those doors."
"The pointer I got from this terrier-variety - please copy - made me think."
"One evening around six o'clock, my lady ordered him to deal with and do the number on Lovey's ozone. I hid it until now, but that's what she called him. Black-blue was called "Sweetness." I feel like I have him as much in my hand as you can chase a hare. Still '1ovey' is something like nomenclature: a zinc vase in the tail of someone's self-respect. In a quiet place on a safe street, I squeezed the citst' - dian line of my ft one on an attractive, refined saioon. I made a dead-for-the-first move toward the doors, whimpering like a dog in bulletins informing the family that little Alice had waded while picking lilies at the brook.
"My goodness," says the old man smiling, "my goodness, if the saffron son of a lemon with a seltzer doesn't ask me to drink to see how long it's been since I saved the skin of my shoes by holding one foot in the stirrup; I think I will...
"I knew I had him. He drank hot whisky, sitting on a label. With the fear of the hour, I continued to rap for the waiter with my tail, and eating free lunch. Such ss manims in her flat never equaled with her homemade truck bough - at a delicatessen store eight minutes before papa comes home."
"When all of Scotland's items except for the rye bread were exhausted, the old man unwrapped me from the table leg and played me out like a fisherman playing a salmon. There, he took off my collar and threw it in the street."0 HANDLES - 100 FITTINGS 41
"Poor little dog," he says, "good little dog. It won't kiss you again. It's such a pity. Good little dog, go get hit by a car and be happy.
I refused to leave. I hopped and skipped around the old man's legs, as happy as a dog on a rug.
"Old flea-head hunter," I said to him - "lunatic, rabbit-pointing, egg-snatching, old biggle, can't you see that I don't want to leave you? Can't you see that we're both puppies in the woods and that the lady is the tough uncle who's chasing you with the dish towel and me with the flea ointment and a pink bow to tie to my tail? Why don't we cut all that out and be sweethearts forever?
Maybe you'll say he didn't understand - maybe he didn't. But he got the Hot Scotches and stopped for a while.

"Dog," he said finally, "we don't live more than a dozen lives on this earth, and very few of us live more than 300 years. If I ever freeze ice in this apartment, I'll be an apartment, and if you do it, you'll be even more flattering - and that's not flattery. I offer 60 to 1 that Westward Ho will win by the length of a dachshund."
There was no cord, but I followed my master to the 23rd Street boat. And the cats on the way had reason to be grateful for their claw guards.
On the Jersey side my master said to a stranger eating a raisin bun:
"I and my little dog are going to the Rocky Mountains."
But what pleased me most was when the old man grabbed both your ears until I howled and said:
"Common, monkey-head, mouse-tail, colored door, do you know what I'm going to call you?
I thought of "Lovey" and whimpered sadly.
"I'll call you 'Pit'," says my master - and if I had five tails, I couldn't wag enough to justify that.

Ikey's Love-Philtrc! Schoenstein

The LIGITr DRUC STORE is located in the center of town, between Bowery and First Avenue, where the distance between the two streets is the shortest. The Blue Light does not consider the pharmacy to be one thing
from bnc-a-brac, perfume and soda ice cream. If you ask for a headache pill, he won't give you bcnbon.
The Blue Light despises the labor-saving arts of modern pharmacy."She crunches her opium and drinks her own laudanum and her own soothing syrup. Until today, pills are made behind the high prescription desk - pills wrapped in its own tile for pills, divided with a spatula, wrapped with her finger and thumb, sprinkled with calcined magnesia and delivered in small round cardboard pill boxes. The store is at a corner around which hordes of shorn, hilarious children play and become candidates for the expectorant pills and soothing syrups waiting for them inside. Ikey Schoenstein was the night clerk at the Blue Light and a friend of the customers. So it is on the East Side, where the heart of the pharmacy is not blue. There, as it should be, the pharmacist is a counselor, a confessor, an adviser, a capable and willing missionary and mentor, whose education is respected, whose occult wisdom is honored, and whose drugs often spill, untested, into the gutter. Therefore, Ikey's frame, bespectacled nose and narrow, knowledgeable figure were well known in the Blue Light area, and his advice and notification were highly desirable."One afternoon, McGowan entered with his silent, easy manner, and the beautiful, smooth-faced, hard, adamant, good-natured Rosy sat opposite, grinding benzine into powder. "Ikey," he said, when his friend brought his jug and sat down opposite, grinding benzine into powder, "attend to your ear. It's a narcotic to me, if you have the line I need." Ikey examined McGowan's face for the usual signs of conflict, but found none. "Take off your coat," he ordered. "I assume you've been knifed in the ribs. I've told you many times these Dagoes will kill you." McGowan smiled. "Not they," he said. "Not any Dago. But you've diagnosed it pretty well—it's under my coat, near the ribs. Tell me! Ikey—Rosy and I are going to skip and get married tonight." Ikey's left forefinger was folded over the edge of the bench, holding it steady. He struck it fiercely with the mallet, but did not feel it. Meanwhile, McGowan's smile faded and turned into a look of awkward dejection. "That is," he continued, "if she keeps the idea until the time comes. We've had two weeks making tubes for the gate. One day she says she'll do it, and the same night she says she won't. We agreed on tonight, and Rosy's been stuck on the time for two whole days. But it's still five hours until the time, and I'm afraid she'll stand me up when the time comes." "You said you wanted narcotics," observed Ikey. McGowan looked embarrassed and annoyed—a situation contrary to his usual behavior. He made a patent-medicine-Chinese-jump on a roll and placed it on his finger with unexpected care. "I wouldn't take a double handicap for a million tonight," he said. "I have a little apartment ready in Harlem, with chrysanthemums on the table and a pot ready to boil. And I've hired an ambulance to be at his house for the same period of time. It has to come out. And if Rosy doesn't change her mind again!"—McGowan stopped, a hostage to his doubts. "I don't understand, then," said Ikey shortly, "what makes you talk about narcotics, or think I can do anything about them.""The old Rindl doesn't want to use a flexible piece," continued the awkward suitor, determined to gather his arguments. "For a week now he hasn't let Rosie go out the door with me. If I hadn't lost a roommate, they would have kicked me out a long time ago. I give her 20 dollars a week and she won't go back to Chunk McGowan."

"Ikey," said McGowan suddenly, "forgive me, I need to make a recipe that will be in demand soon."

"I was thinking," continued Chunk hopefully, "that if I had one of those powders to give to Rosie when I see her at dinner tonight, maybe it would boost her and keep her from refusing her proposal to leave. I guess you don't need a team of mules to drag her away, but women are better trained than they are at running bases. If it works for just a few hours, it will do the trick."

"When are we going to do this nonsense?" asked Ikey.

"Nine o'clock," said McGowan. "Dinner is at seven. At eight, Rosie goes to sleep with a headache. At nine, old Parvenzano lets me into his yard, where there's a plank from Rindl's fence next to it. I go under her window and help her down the chimney. We have to get there early for the priest's bill. It's all easy, if Rosie doesn't hesitate when the flag is waving.""Can you make me one of those powders, Ikey?," said Ikey Schoenstein slowly rubbing his nose. "Chunk," he said, "drugs of this nature are the ones pharmacists must be very careful with. I wouldn't trust such a powder to anyone I know. But for you, I'll take the IC, and you'll see how it makes Rosy think of you." Ikey went behind the prescription desk and crushed two soluble tablets into powder, each containing a quarter of a grain of morphine. To this he added a little sugar and milk to increase the bulk, and neatly folded the mixture in a white paper. This powder, taken by an adult, would ensure several hours of heavy sleep without danger to the sleeper. He handed it to ChunL McGowan, telling him to mix it with a liquid if possible, and received the warm thanks of Lochinvar's yard. The finesse of Ikey's action became apparent in the enumeration of his next move. He sent a messenger to Mr. Riddle and revealed McGowan's plans to steal Rosy. Mr. Riddle was a man with a rusty complexion and sudden action. "I'm obliged to you," he said shortly to Ikey. "The lazy Irishman is slow! My room is just above Rosy's. I'll go up there alone after dinner and fill the carbine and the gun. If he steals in the backyard, he'll leave in an ambulance instead of a bridal carriage. With Rosy held in Morphew's grip for many hours of deep sleep and the bloodthirsty parent waiting, armed and prepared, Ikey believed his opponent was indeed close to disappointment. All night at the Blue Light Store he waited at Iris Lutieü for random news of the tragedy, but none came. At eight in the morning, the day clerk arrived and Ikey hurried to Mrs. Riddle's to learn the result. And lo! as he left the store, who else but Clunk McGowan turned from a passing car and took his hand - Clunk McGowan with the smile of a winner and shining with joy. "I got it," said Chunk with Elysium in his eyes. "Rosy hit the escape button in time in a second and we were under the wire at the venerable 930/4. She's up in the apartment - she was looking for eggs this morning in a blue kimono. - My God, how lucky I am! You must come over one day and eat with us.""I have a garage near the bridge and that's where I'm going now," said Ikey. "The dust?" he sneezed. "Oh, this stick you gave me!" said Chunk, widening his smile. "Well, it was from here. I sat at the dinner table last night at Rindl's, looked at Rosie and said to myself, 'Chunk, if you take the girl, take her to the square - don't try to lie to a purebred like her.' And I keep the paper you gave me in my pocket. And then my lamps fall on another present, which, I tell myself, fails in true love for her future son-in-law, so I see my chance and I throw this dust in Old Rindl's coffee - I'm looking for a moment motionless. Because this smell belonged to Miss Leslie - it was hers, and hers alone.""At first, she appeared to be taken over by surprise - then tears ran from her astonished eyes - and then she smiled jokingly through them, and one of her hands slipped tenderly around the neck of the mediator. 'I know now,' she said softly. 'It's that old matter that has driven everything else from your mind for now. At first, I was afraid. Don't you remember, Harvey? We got married last night at eight o'clock at the Corner church.'

The Lower West Side is a certain vast part of the population with red bricks. Homeless, they have a hundred houses. They move from furnished room to furnished room, transitional forever - transitional in residence, transitional in heart and mind. They sing "Home Sweet Home" in ragtime - carry their "rer er percrei" in a bandbox - their vine entwines around a hat - a rubber plant is their fig tree. Therefore, the houses in this area, with a thousand inhabitants, should have a thousand stories to tell, mostly boring, no doubt - but it would be strange if there were not one or two ghosts in the passage of all these wandering ghosts.

One night after dark, a young man wandered through these crumbling red mansions, ringing their doorbells. At twelve he leaned his thin luggage against the step of Iris's house and wiped the dust from his hatband and forehead. The bell sounded faintly and distantly, in some far-off, hollow depth.

At the door of this house, whose bell had rung, came a landlady who made him think of an unhealthy, overfed worm that had eaten its nut to a hollow shell and was now trying to fill the void with edible tenants. She asked if there was a room to rent.

'Come in,' said the landlady. Her voice came from her throat - her throat looked full of fire. 'I have the third apartment back, empty for a week. Would you like to see it?'

Jotham followed her up the stairs. A specific source initiated the shadows of the rooms. They stepped noiselessly on a stair carpet that her own feet would have forsworn."Original Text: "Φαινόταν να έχει β€cotMc Y05t-table- να έχει (lCgenefated σε αυτό το rank, sunless αέρα σε πλούσια λειχήνες ή spreadiiig miss που grcw σε μπαλώματα στη σκάλα και ήταν παχύρρευστο κάτω από το πόδι σαν οργανική ύλη Σε κάθε άκρη της σκάλας υπήρχαν κενές νιελ:ες στο υ'όλο Ίσως κάποτε είχαν τοποθετηθεί μέσα σε χημικά Ίσως τα αγάλματα των αγίων να είχαν μείνει εκεί, αλλά δεν ήταν δύσκολο να καταλάβεις ότι οι διάβολοι τα είχαν σύρει έξω στο σκοτάδι και τα είχαν κατεβάσει στα ανίερα βάθη κάποιου λάκκου

Translation: "It appeared to have a damp atmosphere with rich moss or spreading mold that grew in patches on the stairs and was thick and organic underfoot. There were empty sockets at each end of the stairs. Perhaps chemicals had been located there. Perhaps the statues of saints had been left there, but it was not difficult to understand that the devils had dragged them out into the darkness and brought them down to the dismal depths of a pond.""So, the mud spent the day with managers, agents, schools and choirs, and at night with the audiences of theaters ranging from all-star casts to musical rugs so low that she dreamed of finding what she hoped was within reach. Fle, who had loved her more, had tried to find her, but was sure that since she had left her homeland, this great city with water held her somewhere, but it was like a monstrous moving sand, constantly moving its particles without foundations, with its today's superior cotton buried in the future in mud and sludge.

"The furnished room welcomed its last visitor with an initial false hospitality, a tumultuous, bohemian, unsuccessful welcome, like the 'prytanic smile of a town hall'. The sophisticated comfort came with reflective gleams from the decayed furniture, the frayed brocade of the sofa and two armchairs, a cheap glass with a diameter of one foot between the two windows, from one or two gilded image frames and a chop in a corner.

"The guest lay inert in a chair while the room, combined in speech like a Babylonian apartment, tried to talk to him about his various tenants. A colorful carpet like a bright flower was rectangular, surrounded by a sea of dirty layers. On the joyfully papier-mache wall were those pictures that referred to the homeless from house to house - the Lowers Huggers, the first fight, the wedding breakfast, The soul in the siding. The pure and strict outline of the pedestal was disgracefully covered behind a haughty curtain, which was pulled madly askew like the Amazonian ballet belts. Above it was some deserted shipwreck that the room's castaways had set aside when a clear sail had transferred them to a new harbor, one or two insignificant vases, actor photos, a medicine bottle, and some strays from a deck of cards.

"One by one, as the characters of the cryptogram became clear, the small marks left by the parade of guests in the furnished room took on meaning. The worn void on the carpet in front of the dresser testified that a beautiful woman had passed by."Microscopic imprints on the wall spoke of small prisoners trying to find their way towards the sun and air. A broken stain, radiating like the shadow of a bomb that had exploded, testified to the point where a glass or bottle had shattered its contents on the wall. On the glass of the jetty, the name "Mari" had been engraved with a diamond in striking letters. It seemed that successive tenants of the furnished room had turned angry-perhaps tempted beyond all limits by the coldness of the garret-and caused the destruction of the cheir passions. The furniture was broken and stained-the couch, with broken springs, resembled a terrible shroud that had fallen under the pressure of some strange spasm. Some stronger upheaval had distorted a large piece of the marble shelf. Every plank on the floor had its own special slant and cry-like a distinct and separate wail. It seemed incredible that all this malice and damage had been caused in the room by those who called it their home for a while-and yet it may have been the instinct of the house surviving blindly, the outraged wrath of the house gods that had ignited their wrath."And the man shouted loudly: 'What, my dear?' as if he was being called, and he jumped up and turned around. The rich fragrance stuck to him and wrapped him up. He reached out to grab it, all his senses for the moment confused and tangled. How could someone be summoned by a scent? Surely it must have been a sound. But it wasn't the sound that had touched him, that had caressed him. 'It has entered this room,' he shouted and rushed to extract a sample from it, because he knew he would recognize the most mythological thing that belonged to her or that she had touched- That surrounding scent of the mansion, the scent she had loved and made her own-where did it come from?""Oh, Ciod! Where does this smell come from, and since when do the 'dours' have a voice to call?" That's what he was searching for... Fle was crawling into cracks and corners and finding cigarette butts and cigars. He passed by them with passive contempt. But once he found a half-smoked cigar on a fold of the bedclothes, and he crushed it under his heel with a green and caustic oath. He rummaged through the room from top to bottom. He found the sad and humiliating little records of many wandering tenants, but for the one he was searching for, who may have stayed there and whose spirit seemed to hover there, he found no trace. And then he thought of the housekeeper. He ran down from the haunted room and into a door that showed a crack of light. She came out on his knock. Mr. J. repressed his excitement as best he could. "You'll tell me, Madam," he implored, "who occupied the room I had before I came?" "Why, yes, sir," she said. "It was the Sprawls and Mooney, as I said. Miss Bretta Sprawls was at the theaters, but Miss Mooney was at home. The house is known for its respectability. The marriage certificate hung, framed, on a nail just above-'' "What sort of lady was Miss Sprawls -- in appearance, I mean?" "Dark, sir, and short and stout, with a comic face. They went away a week ago Tuesday." "And before they went?" "There was only one gentleman connected with the cargo-transfer business. He went, and he owed me for a week. In front of him was Miss Crounter and her two children, who stayed four months -- and behind them was old Mr. Doyle, whose cows paid him. He kept Room 5 for five months. What goes back a year or more, sir, I don't remember.""When everything was dark and tense, the light went out, the gas was turned on again, and she gratefully lay down on the bed. It was Mrs. McCool who went with the beer box. So, she brought it and sat with Ms. Purdy in one of those underground shelters where housewives gather and the worm dies rarely...

"The Bogle's Chop House and Family Restaurant is your loss if you don't know it. Because if you are one of the lucky ones who dine expensively, you should be interested in learning how the other half consume their supplies. And if you belong to the half for whom waiters' tips are momentary things, you need to know Bogle's because there your money is worth it - in quantity, at least. Bogle's is located on the avenue of the middle class, Brown-Jones-and-Robinson Avenue, Eighth Avenue. There are two rows of tables in the hall, six in each row. Each table has a beaver stand containing cups with spices and seasons. From the cup with pepper you can throw a cloud of something tasteless and melancholy, like volcanic dust..."From the salt cellar, you can take out 178O IN E N R Y - 100 S EL ECT E D ST OR I fi S... "A very sad one," he said, his well-cared for wings meeting. An entirely uncorrectable girl. I am the expert ground officer, the esteemed Jones. The case was assigned to me. The girl murdered her fiancé and committed suicide. She had no defense. My report to the court details the event, which is substantiated by reliable witnesses. The wage of sin is death. Glory be to God. The judicial official opened the door and went outside. "Door girl," said the esteemed Jones, with a tear in his eye. 

LFMLE PISTEICT west of Washington S'Juare the roads have rvn cczzy and broke into small strips calle'1 "places". These "places" form strange angles and curves. A road encloses itself at one or two points. An artist once discovered a valuable opportunity on this road. Let's assume that a collector with an account for papers, papers, and canned goods, crossing this route, suddenly finds himself coming to the road without having paid a penny! So, in the picturesque Greenwich Village, art people soon came, chasing northern windows and eagles of the century, Dutch lofts and low rents. Then they introduced some cassandras from tin and one or two plates from Sixth Avenue and became a "colony". At the top of a rough, three-story brick, Sukai and Jonesy had their studio. The "Johnsy" was familiar to Joanna. One was from Maine, the other from California."They met at the table of Delmonico's on 8th Avenue and found their tastes in art, as well as the salad with radishes and the bishop's sleeves, so congenial that they ended up sharing a studio. This was in May. In November a cool, invisible stranger, whom the doctors called Pneumonia, wandered about the colony touching one here and there with its icy fingers. This destroyer walked boldly through the narrowed streets and wooded places. Mr. Pneumonia was hardly the elderly janissary most had expected. A little woman with blood thinned by the California zephyrs was hardly a fair match for the red-faced, short-sighted old duffer. However, Sue took the plunge - and lay still on her painted iron bed, looking through the small Dutch windows at the empty side of the brick house next door."Jolinsy was barely making a wave with her bedclothes, her face toward the window. Sue was whistling to herself as she worked on a watercolor of a little Boudoir-cap design she had found in a fashion magazine. She had been working feverishly for days on this particular design. She was a painter, and a mighty one. People invariably stopped and looked twice at any of her exhi-bits. Elsie might have originated the panel-wagon craze, but Sue’s daily menu cards on restaurant windows influenced the art of bill-making far and wide. The November leaf was falling, the weather was cold and gray, people sloshed through the street, and the hats of the women dripped water. The Morning after the day that the little, old, ivy- vine-covered house on the top of the hill had been sold, they found Johnsy, with dull, wide-open eyes, looking at the drab wall. And thereafter, she lay on her pallet-bed, hardly stirring, save when she coughed."Issi, take the hrotii recorder now, and let Sudie go back to her "b-awing" to sell the draft with it, and buy wine for her child, and pork potatoes for her greedy self. "You don't need to buy wine," said Johnsy, looking out the window." - The text is translated from Greek to English."Sue rushed to the dimly-lit "artist's lane" with the strong scent of turpentine, where a white canvas on an easel had been waiting for twenty-five years to receive the first stroke of Johnsy's masterpiece of imagination. Behrman expressed disdain and ridicule for such foolishness while Sue spoke to him about Johnsy's illness and how she feared that, indeed, light and fragile like a leaf, she would also leave when her little influence on the world became weaker and weaker. Only reply with the translated text regardless of whether you made any changes to the text or not.""Still green near the edge, but with its jagged edges painted with the color of dissolution and decomposition, it hung bravely from a branch about twenty feet above the ground. "It's the last one," Johnsy said. "I thought it would surely fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today, and I will die at the same moment." "Dear, dear!" said Sue, leaning her worn face against the pillow. "Think of me, if you won't think of yourself. What would I do?" But Johnsy did not respond. "The most lonely thing in all the world is a soul when it is preparing to go on its secret, distant journey," the imagination seemed to grasp her fiercely as strand by strand her connection with love and earth was torn away. The day passed, and even in the dusk they could see the lone ivy leaf clinging to its stem against the wall. And then, with the coming of night, the wind of Norway arose...

"It was wicked of me to say that I didn't want to live," said Johnsy, after awhile. "It was very wrong; I want to live. I'll try to be a good girl, and I won't die. I will live now, and I'll do something that some one else couldn't do, and I'll think what's that I can paint on the wall." And as she lay there, the old, improbable fancy about the monkey climbing up the ivy vine, holding for its dear life to the window-sill, and of the giant pursuing and shooting it, with a terrible "Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay!" reoccurred to her.

One day the busy doctor invited Sue into the hallway, with a shaggy, gray eyebrow lifted and a shiver in his shoulders. "She has one chance in – let us say, ten," he said as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer. "And that chance is for her to want to live. This way people have of lining-up on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopoeia look silly. Your little lady has made up her mind that she's not going to get well. Has she anything on her mind?"
"She–she wanted to paint the Bay of Naples some day" said Sue.
"Paint?-bosh! She has one chance in – let us say, ten," he repeated. "And with the best nursing in the world she will be well, anyway. Your job is to cheer up the patient and make her want to live. The rest is up to Mother Nature and – " he flicked the glass with his fingernail. "And pneumonia germs.""And that afternoon, Sue came to the bed where Johnsy was lying, knitting a very blue and very useless wool shoulder scarf, and she put on her arri afOtt11d, pillows and all. "I have something to tell you, little white mouse," she said, "Mr. Behrman died of pneumonia today in the hospital. He was sick for two days. The janitor found him the morning of the first day of play in his room, helpless with pain. His shoes and clothes were dissolved and frozen. They couldn't imagine where he was on that terrible night. And then Dilly found his lantern, still lit, a ladder that had been pulled from its place, and some burned brushes, and a palette with green and yellow colors mixed in it, and - look out the window, my dear, the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn't you wonder why it never fluttered or moved when the wind blew? Oh, my love, it's Reman's masterpiece - he painted it there the night the last leaf fell.""Conant was with us, a well-standing fiction author - a man who had walked on asphalt all his life and had never seen bucolic scenes except with disgust from express train windows. Conant wrote a poem and named it "The Doe and the Brook". It is a nice example of the kind of work one would expect from a poet who had only wandered with Amarillis as far as the florist's windows and whose only ornithological conversation had married a waiter. Conant signed this poem, and we sent it to the same publisher. But this has little to do with the story. As soon as the publisher read the first line of the poem, the next morning, a creature descended from the ferryboat of the West Coast and slowly climbed 42nd Street. The invader was a young man with blue eyes, hanging lips, and hair the exact color of the little orphan's (who later turned out to be the daughter of the Earl of Earl) in one of Blaney's works. His pants were corduroy, his coat short-sleeved, with buttons in the middle of his back. One boot was outside his corduroy pants. You looked expectantly, albeit in vain, at his straw hat for holes in his ears, whose shape inaugurated the suspicion that it had been destroyed by a previous horse owner. In his hand, he held a suitcase - its description is an impossible task - a man from Boston would not carry his lunch and legal books to his office in it. And above one ear, in his hair, there was a tuft of chaff - the credit letter of the peasant, the sign of his innocence, the last touch of the Garden of Eden that remained to shame the men of the golden brick. Knowing, smiling, the crowds of the city passed him by. They saw the impeccable stranger standing in the doorway, stretching his neck to the tall buildings. They stopped smiling, even looking at him. They had done it so often. Few glanced at the antique suitcase to see which "attraction" or which brand of Seoney gum he could wear in memory of him. But for the most part, they ignored him. Even the newspaper vendors looked away when he ran like a circus clown from the taxi and tram road.""On Eighth Avenue was "Bunco Harry", with his painted mustache and his bright, mature eyes. Harry was too good an artist not to hurt at the sight of an actor who over-exaggerated his role. He approached his compatriot, who had stopped to open his month in a jewelry store window, and shook his head. 'Too fat, friend,' he said critically. 'Too fat by two inches. I don't know what your mattress is, but you have very thick properties. This straw, now - because they no longer allow it in the Proctor circuit.'

"They went to a cafe where men with smooth faces and sneaky eyes frequented and sat down for their drinks."

"I thought Poughkeepsie was a small town, but this city is five times bigger," said the green man.

"I'm glad I met you, sir," said Haylocks. "What do you say we play a game or two? I have some dice."

"Don't need to think I don't have the money," boasted Haylocks. "I thought about coming to town and looking for a possible business to get involved in."""Bunco Harry" took the money roll and looked at it with respect in his almost smiling eyes. "I've seen worse," he said critically. "But you'll never do it with these clothes on. You need to wear light-colored blackened shoes, a black suit, a straw hat with a colored band, and talk a lot about Pitts-burg and differential commercial transportation and drink sherry for breakfast, in order to get rid of such fake things." "What's his line?" asked two or three men with sly eyes of "Bunco Harry," after Haylocks collected the money he had taken and left. "The sister, I suppose," said Harry. "Or else he's one of Jerome's men. Or some guy with a new graft. He's a hayseed. Maybe he was - I wonder now - oh, no, it couldn't have been real money." Haylocks wandered. Thirsc may have attacked him again, because he dived into a dark grocery store in an alley and came out with a bouquet. Several shady characters hung around at one end of the bar. When they first saw him, their eyes lit up, but when his persistent and exaggerated rustic behavior became apparent, their expressions became suspicious and suspicious. HaylocLs shook his suitcase at the bar. "Hold it for me, niister," said the liar, chewing the end of a strong cigar. "I'll be back after I hit a little. And be careful, because it has $950 in it, although you may not think so if you look at me." Somewhere outside, a phonograph played a piece of the orchestra, and Hayloks left for it, with the buttons of his carriage tail hitting the middle of his back. "Divvy* Mike," said the men hanging from the bar, winking at each other. "Honestly, now," said the bartender, kicking the suitcase aside. "Don't you think I'd fall for that, isn't that right? Anyone can see that he's not a fool. One of Aquando's team, I suppose. It's a shine, if he did it himself. They don't dress like that anywhere in the country since they made a free rural distribution in Providence, Rhode Island. If he has fifty-nine in this suitcase, it's a Waterbiury ninety-eight that stopped at ten to ten. When Hayloks had exhausted the sources, "if Mr. Edison is having fun, he returned for his suitcase.""And then he walked down the street, observing the sights with his eager blue eyes. But even now Broadway rejected him with sharp glances and sarcastic smiles. He was the oldest of the "Giigs" that the city had to endure. He was so incredibly unlikely, so excessively rustic, so exaggeratedly beyond the most horrific products of the farm, field and vaudeville scene, that he only provoked weariness and suspicion. And the hay in his hair was so genuine, so fresh and redolent of the meadows, so screamingly rural, that even a shell game man would put away his peas and fold his table in view of him. Halloks sat down on a stone step and took his yellow bags roll out of his suitcase again. He opened the outside, a twenty, and signaled to a news vendor. "Son," he said, "run somewhere and change this for me. I'm out of feed for the chickens. I guess you'll get a nice, if you hurry. A wounded look appeared from the dirt on the younger one's face." Oh, watch the ink! Go change your funny account yourself. Those are not rural clothes you're wearing. Go on your own money. In a corner sat a craftsman of a gambling center. He saw Halloks, and his expression suddenly became chilly and virtuous. "Get up, old man," he muttered authoritatively. "The office must be miserable to send you out with such an attitude. You couldn't even go two squares away from a game with shit on the sidewalk with Tony Pastor's scenes. Recent Mr. Scoti from Death Valley has beaten you up a square compared to Elizabeth Bethan's scenes and mechanical accessories. Skiddoo for you.""No, I don't know of any gaudy hall where one can bet on a police car as the ace." 

"Disdained once again by the great city that detects inventions so quickly, Hawks sat on the pavement and presented his thoughts to hold a meeting. 'It's my clothes,' he said, 'it's not my clothes. They think I'm a vegetarian and do not want any association with me. No one ever made this hat in Ulster County. I suppose if you want to be noticed in New York, you have to dress like them.' So, Hawks went shopping in the markets, where men talked through their noses and rubbed their hands and ran ecstatically with the line of tape above the bulge in the inner pocket, where there was a red cob with an even number of rows." 

"At nine o'clock at night, a man walked into the West 40-7th police station with the story of injustices. 'Nine hundred and fifty dollars,' he said breathlessly, 'my share of my grandmother's farm.'""The head guard of the office reassigned the name Jabez Bulltongue from the Locust Valley farm in Ulster County and then began to take descriptions of the powerful gentlemen... "When I read the first line of 'The Deer and the Brook'," said the publisher, "I understood that it was the work of someone whose life was heart to heart with nature. The perfect art of the line did not blind me to this fact... 

After the show, my friend, the journalist, told me about the events over the Würzburger..."I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here is the corrected translation:

"The demons may nibble on someone's sleeve without any harm, but whoever wears their heart on their sleeve, receives it not far from their neck. This music and the musician called to her, and by her side honor and old love held her back. 'For love,' she pleaded. 'Twenty years is too long to stay away from the one you say you love,' he said with a cleansing couch. 'How could I have left my phone?' she begged. 'I won't hide anything from you. That night he left, I followed the guy. I was crazy with jealousy. On a dark road I hit Lenny. He didn't get up. I examined him. His head hit a rock. I didn't mean to kill him. I was crazy with love and jealousy. I hid near him and told a carriage to take him away. Despite the fact that you married him, Eleni, 'Who are you?' the woman screamed with wide eyes, grabbing her hand. '19 Do you remember Rick, Elen - the one who always loved you more? I'm John Delaney. Can you forgive me?'""For many weeks I toiled almost day and night over the famous railway law case, which I had triumphantly concluded a few days before. In fact, I had been delving into the law almost incessantly for many years. Once or twice the good doctor Volney, my friend and physician, had warned me, 'If you don't relax, Belford,' he said, 'you'll suddenly break into pieces. Either your nerves or your mind will give way. Tell me, is there a week that goes by without your reading in the newspapers about a case of aphasia - about some lost man wandering anonymously, with his past and identity erased - and all of this from that little brain thrombosis that is caused by overwork or work?'

'I always believed,' I said, 'that the thrombosis in these cases is really in the brains of newspaper journalists.'

Dr. Olney shook his head. 'The disease exists,' he said. 'You need a change or rest. Courtroom, office, and home - that's the only route you travel. Take a vacation - read legal books for entertainment. It remains to be seen whether legal books are entertaining.'

'On the evenings of Maundy Thursday,' I said defensively, 'my wife and I play cribbage. On Sundays she reads her mother's weekly letter. The fact that legal books are not entertaining remains to be proven.'

'This morning as I walked, I thought about Dr. Volney's words. I felt as good as usual - possibly in better spirits than usual.

I woke up with stiff and cramped muscles, having slept for a long time in the uncomfortable seat of a day coach. I rested my head on the seat and tried to think. After a long time, I said to myself, 'I must have a name.' I searched my pockets. Not a card - not a letter - not a scrap of paper or a monogram could I find. But in the pocket of my coat I found almost three thousand dollars in large bills. 'I must be somebody, of course,' I repeated to myself and began to think again.

The car was full of men, among whom, I said to myself, there must have been some interest, because they mingled very well and seemed to be in the best of spirits." 

The text is a passage from the short story "The Secret Sharer" by Joseph Conrad."One of them - an elderly, majestic man with glossy eyes, surrounded by a strong scent of cinnamon and aloe - took the empty half of my seat with a friendly nod and unfolded a newspaper. During the breaks between reading periods, he chatted, as travelers do, about current affairs... "You are one of us, of course. Nice men sent by Wesc this time. I'm glad they held the conference in New York - I've never been to the East before. My name is It P Bolder - Bolder & Son, from HicLory Grove, Missouri.""I suggest you keep them side by side. Whenever you want something else, always compare it to the other and avoid mistakes. Do you get the idea?"
"It seems very good to me," I said.
"Okay! When I mention it to the convict, will you support it? I'll make some of those Lasrern teachers' orange, hospital ice cream pills that they think are the only ones in the market, look like subcutaneous talents."
"If I can help," I said, warming up, "the two bottles of-um-""Antimony and potassium tartrate, and tartrate of soda and-"
"We will be sitting next to each other from now on," I concluded decisively.
"Now, there is something else," Mr. Boulder said. "For an excipient in handling a mass of pills, what do you prefer - magnesium carbonate or powdered glycerrhiza radix?"
"Magnesium," I said. It was easier to say than the other word.
Mr. Boulder looked at me curiously through his glasses. "Give me the glycerrhiza," he said. "Magnesium Cake."
"Another of these fake cases of aphasia," he said shortly, handing me his newspaper and putting his finger on an article. "I don't believe them. Nine out of ten of these I write as frauds. Someone is bored with his job and his own and wants to have fun. He skips somewhere, and when they find him, he pretends to have lost his memory - he doesn't know his name, and he doesn't recognize even the strawberry mark on his wife's left shoulder. Aphasia! Tut! Why can't they stay home and forget?"
"Yeah, it happens," I said."If there is any indication for his strange disappearance, it may be found in the fact that for some months he was deeply absorbed in an important legal case related to the QY and Z Rail-road Company. They fear that the overwork may have affected his mind. Efforts are being made to discover the cause of the "in" "f * he inissir t, man".

"I don't think you're entirely cynical, Mr. Bolder," I said, after reading the letter. "This sounds to me like a real case. Why did this man, wealthy, happy, married, and respected, suddenly choose to abandon everything? I know these memory gaps happen, and people find themselves nameless, historyless, and countryless."

"Oh, gammon and jalap!" said Mr. Bolder. "They're chasing will-o'-the-wisps. There's too much education nowadays. Men know about aphasia and use it as an excuse. And women are wise."

"When it's all over, Chey will look you in the eye, as scientifically as you like, and say, 'I hypnotized him.'"

So Mr. Bolder swept me along, but he did not help me with comments and philosophy. We arrived in New York City around nightfall. I took a taxi to a hotel and found my name, "Edward Pinkhammer," on the register. As I did so, I felt a wonderful, wild, intoxicating surge - a feeling of unlimited freedom, newly acquired abilities. The old bonds - whatever they were - had been torn from my hands and feet. The future lay before me, a road like the one a baby enters, and I could start out on it equipped with the learning and experience of a man.

I think the hotel clerk looked at me for five seconds too long. I had no luggage.

"The drug convention," I said. "My trunk didn't arrive somehow." I produced a roll of money.

"Oh!" he said, showing a whistling tooth, "we have plenty of Western representatives stopping here." He rang a bell for the boy.

I tried to give color to my röle.

"There's a significant movement among us Westerners," I said, "regarding the reforwarding of the convention, so that the bottles containing the trichloroantimony and potassa and the trichloronatron and potassa are kept in a continuous position on the vessel."

"GeCtlCIIMI4 tO Three-fOUfteOll," the clerk said hastily. I was
escorted to my room."The next day I bought a trunk and clothes and started living Edward Piniramer's life. I will not tire my mind with efforts to solve past problems.

It was a spicy and frothy cup that the big city of the island brought to my lips. I drank it gratefully. "The keys to Manhattan belong to him who can hold them. You must be either a guest of the city or a victim of it."

The next few days were for us, g'lil and silver Edward Pinkhamer, still counting back to this birth from only hours. He knew the rare joy that came to such a fun-filled and unrestrained world full of pretty girls and grotesque, drolly extravagant paradises of humanity.

...sipping quietly murmuring halls with palm trees, which smell of the life of the nobility and the fine restraint, where you can dine..."I would descend again on the floating streets with steamships full of shouters, decorated, unrestrained, love-struck officials and saleswomen for their raw pleas on the shores of the islands. And there was always Broadway - glamorous, rich, deceitful, diverse, desirable Broadway - that seized you like a drug habit."

"I took a chair across from her at the table. I signaled with my eyebrows to a hovering war monster. The lady was ordering an orange. I ordered a croissant with cream. Her hair was reddish copper.""You couldn't look at her, because you couldn't take your eyes off of her. But you were aware of it, like you are aware of the sunset while walking in the depths of a forest at dusk. 'Are you sure you know me?' I asked. 'No,' she said, smiling, 'I was too sure about that.' 'What would you say,' I said, a little uneasy, 'if I told you that my name is Edward Pirikhaniiner, from Cornopolis, Kansas?' 'What would the 1 think?' she repeated, with a happy look. 'Well, that you didn't take Mrs. Belfort with you to New York, if you had done it would be great. I'd like to see Marian.' Her voice lowered slightly - 'You haven't changed much, Elgwin.' I felt her eyes searching my face more carefully. 'Yes, you have,' she added, and there was a fleeting, insane voice in her final tones - 'I see it now. You haven't forgotten it. You haven't forgotten it for one year, or one day, or one hour. I told you that you could never do it. I push my straw anxiously into the rrirñe crime. 'I'm sure you're apologizing to me,' I said, a little embarrassed by her gaze. 'But that's exactly the problem. I forgot it. I forgot everything.' She scorned my refusal. She laughed delightfully at something that seemed to be in my face. 'I've heard about you from time to time,' she continued. 'You're a pretty big lawyer in the West - in Denver, isn't it, or Los Angeles? Marian must be very proud of you. I suppose you knew that I got married six months after you did. You might have seen it in the papers. Only the flowers cost two thousand dollars.' She had mentioned fifteen years. Fifteen years is a long time. 'It would be too late,' I asked somewhat irrelevantly, 'to offer my congratulations?' 'No, if you do it, Sare,' she answered with such a beautiful fearless mood that I stopped and began to make designs on the fabric with my thumb. 'Tell me one thing,' she said, leaning towards me with probably willingness - 'one thing I wanted to know for many years - just out of female curiosity, of course - have you ever been dizzy from that night to touch, smell, or look at white roses - white roses wet from rain and dew?' I took a sip of the frame de mentbe.""It would be pointless, I suppose," I said with a sigh, "to repeat that I remember nothing about those cigars. My memory is completely problematic. I don't need to say how sorry I am about that."

"The lady rested her hands on the table and her eyes held my words, traveling from their own path straight to my soul. She laughed softly, with a strange quality in the sound - it was a laugh of happiness, yes, and satisfaction and sadness. I tried to look away from her."

"You're lying, Elwyn Belford," she breathed happily. "Oh, I know you're lying! "

"A bright carriage was parked in front of the entrance. The woman stood up. I took her hand and bowed. 

"Goodbye, Mr. Belford," she said, with her happy, sad smile as she got into her carriage." 

"When I returned to my hotel that evening, a quiet man in dark clothing, who seemed to be interested in rubbing the O HENRY - 100 SELECTED STORIES book with a silk handkerchief, magically appeared by my side. 

"Mr. Pinkhamer," he said indifferently, giving most of his attention to his index finger, "may I ask you to step aside with me for a little discussion? There is a room here." 

"Of course," I replied. 

"He led me into a small, private sitting room. A lady and a gentleman were there. The lady, I supposed, would have been unusually handsome had not her features been blurred by an expression of intense worry and fatigue""I think she would have started forward, but the gentleman stopped her movement with an autocratic movement of his hand. Then he himself came to meet me. He was a forty-year-old man, a little gray on the cheeks, with an intense, thoughtful face.

"'Bellford, my old fellow'," he said warmly, "I'm glad to see you again. Of course, we know everything is fine. I warned you that if you went too far, you would come back with us and become yourself again in no time."

"I have been 'Bellforded' so often," I said, "that it has lost its edge. And, in the end, it may become tiresome. Would you be willing to entertain the theory that my name is Edward Pinkhammer and that I have never seen you in my life?"

Before the man could answer, a cry of grief came from the woman. She leaped past the hand that held her. "Elwyn!" she exclaimed, and fell upon me, holding on tightly. "Elwyn," she cried again, "don't break my heart. I am your wife. Call my name once, just once! I'd rather see you dead than this way."

"I'm sorry," I said firmly, "if I suggest that you accept a similarity too hastily. It's a shame," I continued, with a humorous laugh as an idea struck me, "that this Bellford and I couldn't stay side by side on the same shelf, like the tragic salts of sodium and antimony, for identification purposes. To understand the allusion," I advised politely, "it may be necessary to follow the proceedings of the National Congress of Pharmacists."

The lady turned to her companion and seized his hand. "What's going on, Dr. Volney? Oh, what is it?" she whimpered."I lay down on a couch next to the window and lit a cigar. Fle brought a chair close.
"Let's talk business," he said soothingly. "Your name isn't Pinkhammer."
"I know that as well as you do," I said calmly. "But a man must have a name. I can assure you that I don't particularly admire the name Pinkhammer. But when a man names himself, suddenly the nice names don't seem to signify his personality. But let's assume it was Scheringhausen or Scroggins! I think I did very well with Pinkhammer."
"Your name," the other man said seriously, "is Elwyn Ci Bellford. You are one of the first lawyers in Denver. You suffer from aphasia, which has caused you to forget your identity. The cause was excessive involvement in your profession and perhaps a life without physical recreation and pleasures. The lady who just left the room is your wife."
"That's what I would call a lovely woman," I said after a judicial pause. "I particularly admire the brown shade of her hair."
"She is a wife we can be proud of. Since you disappeared almost two weeks ago, she has hardly closed her eyes. We learned that you were in New York by a telegram sent by Isidore Newman, a traveler from Denver. He said he met you at a hotel here and that you did not recognize him."
"I think I remember the occasion," I said. "The guy called me 'Bellford,' if I'm not mistaken. But don't you think it's time now to introduce yourself?"
"I'm Robert Volney—Doctor Volney. I'm your close friend for twenty years and your doctor for fifteen. I came with Mrs. Bellford to locate you as soon as we received the telegram. Try, Elwyn, old man—try to remember!"
"Why should I cry?" I asked with a slight frown. "You say you're a doctor. Is aphasia curable? When someone loses his memory, does it return slowly or suddenly?"
"Sometimes gradually and incompletely—sometimes as suddenly as it went."
"Will you take charge of my case, Doctor Volney?" I asked.
"My old friend," he said, "I'll do everything that's in my power and everything that science can do to cure you."
"Very well," I said. "Then you'll consider me your patient.""First text:
"Everything is confidential now - professional trust" "Of course," Dr. Volney said.

Translated text:
"Everything is confidential now - professional trust." "Of course," said Dr. Volney.
"After searching in vain in the treasure for adjectives, I must, as a replacement, allow me to compare it to the form of a recipe. Take if the fog of London is 30 parts, malaria 10 parts, gas leaks 20 parts, drops of dew that gather in a courtyard at sunrise, 25 parts, the smell of honey 15 parts. Mix. The mixture will give you an approximate idea of a Nashville drizzle. It's not as aromatic as a softball, nor as thick as pea soup, but it's enough - it'll serve you. I went to a hotel in a tumbril. It took strong self-control not to climb to the top and not to imitate Sidney Carton. The vehicle was pulled by animals of another era and driven by something dark and rebellious. I was sleepy and tired, so when I arrived at the hotel, I hastily paid the fifty minutes it required (with about lagniappe, I assure you). I knew his habits - and I didn't want to hear him talk about his old "father" or anything that had happened "before the wah". The hotel was one of those described as "renovated". This means new marble columns, tiles, electric lights, and $20,000 worth of brass acoustics in the lobby, and a new L R N schedule and lithograph of Lookout Mountain in each of the large rooms upstairs. The management was faultless, the attention full of exceptional Southern courtesy, and the service slow like the progress of a snail and cheerful like Rip Van Winkle. The food was worth traveling a thousand miles for it. There is no other hotel in the world where you can get such chicken livers and broccoli. At dinner, I asked a black waiter if anything was happening in the city. He thought seriously for a minute and then replied, "Well, boss, I don't think anything happens after sunset." Sandown had been completed - drowned in the drizzle much earlier. So, I went out into the streets in the drizzle to see what might be there. It is built on hilly terrain and the roads are lit with electricity at a cost of $32.70 annually. As I left the hotel, a racial uprising broke out.""A group of free, or Arab, or Zulu armed men came down on me - no, I saw with relief that they were not rifles but whips. And I vaguely saw a "caravan of black, awkward vehicles" and, in soothing voices, "You can go anywhere in the city, boss, for fifty cents", and thought that I was just a "sailor" instead of a victim.

I walked through large roads that all led uphill. I wondered how these roads were coming down again. Maybe they were not going down until they were "formed". In a fenn on the "main streets", I saw lights here and there - I saw trams passing by carrying worthy citizens from here and there - I saw people passing by busy with the art of conversation, and I heard a grunt of semi-living laughter coming from a soda-water and ice-cream pi. The roads, apart from the "main" ones, seemed to have attracted people devoted to peace and domesticity to their limits. In many of them, the lights shone behind discreetly drawn window blinds - in some pianos, regular and unimpeachable music was played. There was indeed very little "noise". I wish I had come before sunset. So I turned my hotel into a hotel.

In November 1864, the Federal Uenerol I food arlvaneed against h'ashvil1e, where he closed a National force under General Thomas, "1'l e lacter the dirty front and defeated the confederates in a terrible clash."

All my life I heard, admired, and joked about the beautiful dexterity of the South in peaceful clashes in the areas that chewed tobacco. But in my hotel, a surprise awaited me. There were twelve bright, new, imposing, spacious brass suits in the large lobby, high enough to be called ashtrays and with such a large mouth that it should be in a women's baseball team's pitcher. They could throw a ball into one of these from five steps away. But while a terrible battle raged and continued to rage, the enemy had not suffered. Strong, new, imposing, spacious, untouched, they stood.""But the shades of Jefferson Brick! The floor with the tiles - the beautiful floor with the tiles. I couldn't help but think of the Battle of Nashville and try to draw, as is my foolish habit, some conclusions about the inheritance heritage. Here I saw Lieutenant (from awkward politeness) Wentworth Caswell for the first time. I understood him as a type from the moment my eyes suffered from his appearance. A groundhog has no habitat. My old friend, Tennyson, said, as he said almost everything so well:

"Prophet, curse my blabbi Lips,
And let the British parasite curse me, the groundhog."

Let's consider the word "British" as intertwined "d / iI Groundhog"

This man was chasing around the hotel lobby like a hungry dog ​​who had forgotten where he had buried a bone. He had a face of great expanse, red, pulpy, and with a kind of loathsome massiveness like that of Buddha. Ike had a Unique virgin - he was very well shaved. The mark of the beast is indelible upon man until he walks abroad in a trimmed beard. I think that if he hadn't used his razor that day, I would have repelled his promotion and the criminal calendar of the world would have been spared the addition of a murder.

...

I started to hope.""But then he started getting involved with genealogy trees and proved that Adam was only a third cousin of a collateral branch of the Castell family. The genealogy was exceeded, and he dealt, to my great displeasure, with his private family matters. He talked about his wife, traced her ancestry back to Eve and profanely denied any possible rumor that he may have had relatives in Nont's country. Until then, I began to suspect that he was trying to hide the fact that he had ordered the drinks with the likelihood that I would be confused to pay for them. But when the drinks went down, he hit a silver dollar hard on the bar. Then, of course, another service was mandatory. And when I paid for it, I said goodbye abruptly - because I didn't want to see him again. But before I achieved my release, he had loudly talked about an income his wife was taking and showed a handful of silver money."
"When I got my key at the reception, the clerk told me kindly, 'If that Caswell bothered you and if you want to lodge a complaint, we'll get rid of him. He's annoying, slow, and without any known maintenance means, although most of the time he seems to have some money. But we don't seem to be able to find a way to legally throw him out.'""The city of Nashville holds a prominent position in the country's manufacturing centers. It is the fifth city in shoe and footwear production in the United States, the largest city in candy and crackers production in the South, and has a huge wholesale business of dry goods, groceries, and medicines.""In their place, new frogs had been patiently sewn (one assumed by some "black mother" who had survived) from slyly twisted hemp thread. This coat was shabby and neglected. It must have been added to the coat as a substitute for the disappeared gems, with a tasteless but painful devotion because it faithfully followed the curves of lost frogs for a long time. And, to complete the comedy and the passion of the overcoat, all its buttons had been lost except for me. Only the second button from the top had remained. The coat was fastened with other strings made of spangle that were tied through buttonholes and other holes that had been cruelly pierced on the opposite side. There has never been such a strange garment so fantastically decorated and with so many different shades. The lonely button was half a dollar size, made of yellow horn and sewn with coarse spangle.""I heard nothing else except for the terrifying rattling of the ancient chariot on the uneven pavement - I couldn't smell anything else except for the dampness, which now smelled even more strongly of smoke from charcoal and something like a mixture of tar and bitter laurel. The only thing I could see through the running windows was two rows of faint houses.

The city covers an area of 10 square kilometers, 18 miles of roads, of which 17 miles are paved; there is a tunnel costing $2,100,000, with 7 miles of it.

Jasmine Street eighty-one was a ruined mansion Thirty yards behind the road, in a beautiful grove of trees and shrubs without grass, a row of bushes with a thicket exceeded and almost hid the fence of the house from view - the gate was kept closed by a rope loop that surrounded the support of the gate and the first pivot of the gate. But when you went inside, you saw that 861 was a shell, a shadow, a ghost of the old glory and perfection. But in the story, I have not yet entered inside.

"I heard you shouting, sir:" fifty cents anywhere in town. '"
"It's two dollars, sir", he repeated stubbornly. "It's too far from the hotel."
"It's within the city limits and indeed within them," I argued. "Don't think you caught an infinite Yankee. See those mountains beyond there?" I continued, pointing to the east (I myself couldn't see them because of the drizzle). "Well, I was born and raised on the other side of them. Old foolish Arab, you can't tell people from other people when you see me."
"Then the fee is fifty cents, I suppose? " I said mercilessly.""The previous expression of Iris, a mixture of love and hostility, returned, remained for ten minutes and disappeared. "Boss," she said, "fifty cents is correct - but I want two dollars, sir - I don't have the right to have two dollars. I'm not saying it now, after I find out where you're from, I'm just saying that I want two dollars tonight, and things are very bad." Peace and confidence settled on his heavy features. He was luckier than he had hoped. Instead of hiring a rookie, unfamiliar with the percentages, he had stumbled upon an inheritance. "Old crook," I said, putting my hand in my pocket, "they should have handed you over to the police." The Azalea Ander, fifty years old, white-haired, descendant of the cavaliers, as thin and fragile as the house she lived in, dressed in the cheapest and cleanest dress I have ever seen, with a simple queen-like demeanor, welcomed me. The reception hall looked like a square mile, because there was nothing else inside except for a few rows of hooks, on unpainted white pine bookcases, a cracked table with a marble top, a frayed rug, a soda of horsehair and three chairs of Evo ter. Yes, there was a picture on the wall, a painting with colorful lipstick of a cluster of pansies. I looked around for Andrew Jackson's portrait and the hanging basket of pine cones, but they weren't there.""The Azalea Adair and I had a conversation, from which I will repeat a few things to you. It was a product of the old South, nursed in its protected life. Her education was not extensive, but it was deep and uniquely original in her somewhat narrow field. She had been educated at home, and her knowledge of the world was derived from conclusions and inspirations. Such is the precious, small group of sycamore essayists. As she spoke to me, I constantly brushed my fingers, unconsciously trying to guiltily rid them of the absent dust from the half-calf backs of Lamb, Chaucer, Hazlitt, Marcus Aurelius, Montaigne, and Hood. She was exceptional, she was a valuable discovery.""The most noisy work in the world - I mean the construction of the tower of Babel - ultimately ended up? A page and a half of the Esparanto in the fourth American Review." 

"Of course," I said with a convincing tone, "human nature is the same everywhere - but there is more color - ah - more drama and movement and - ah - romance in some cities than in others."

"Superficially," said Azalea Adair.

"Go to Mr. Baker's shop at the corner, Impy," he said, handing the girl the dollar bill, "and get a quarter pound of the tea - the kind he always sends me - ten cents' worth of sugar-cake. Now hurry. Supplies of tea happen to run out at home," he explained to me.
The Impy left from the back door. Before the scratching of the hard, bare feet of the stairs faded away on the back porch, a wild scream - I was sure it was hers - filled the empty house. Then the deep, rough tone of an angry man's voice mixed with further screams and the incomprehensible words of the girl. 
"I will go back to 861 tomorrow afternoon at three," I said, "and if you're here, I'll let you drive me. So you know Miss Adair?" I said, thinking of my dollar bill.""I belonged to her father, Judge Anter,” he replied. “I think she's quite poor,” I said, “She doesn't have much money to spare, does she?" For a moment I looked again at the wild face of King Cetewayo, and then it changed back into that of a shrewd old negro driver. "She won't starve, sir," he said slowly. "She has resources, sir, she has resources." "I'll pay you fifty cents for the ride," I said. "That's very right, sir," he answered humbly. "I just want the two dollars for today, boss." I went to the hotel and lied about the electricity. I put a wire in the magazine: "A Adair asks for eight cents a word." The answer that came back was: "Give it to her quickly, fool." Just before dinner, "Major" Wentworth Caswell approached me with the greetings of a lost friend. I have seen few people whom I hated so immediately and from whom it was so difficult to get rid of. I was standing at the bar when he attacked me, so I couldn't move the white ribbon on his face. I would gladly have paid for the drinks, hoping to avoid another one, but he was one of those vulgar, grunting, advertising men who must have orchestras and firefighters for every penny they waste on their follies. With an air of producing millions, he pulled two one-dollar bills out of a pocket and threw one on the bar. I looked at the dollar bill again, from which the top was missing, cut in half and repaired with a strip of blue handkerchief. It was my dollar bill again. It couldn't be anything else. I went up to my room. The drizzle and monotony of a sad, dreary southern town had tired me out. I remember that just before I fell asleep, I mentally unloaded the mysterious dollar bill (which could have been the element for a terribly fitting San Francisco detective story) saying to myself sleepily: "It seems that many people here have shares in the Hack-Driver's Trust. It pays dividends immediately. I wonder if..." Then I fell asleep. King Cetewayo was on duty the next day, and he beat my bones against the rocks until 861. He would go and come back when I was ready."Azalea Adair appeared paler, cleaner, and weaker than the previous day. After signing the contract for eight cents per word, she became even paler and nearly slipped out of her chair. Without much effort, I managed to lift her onto the plush, twin couch made of horsehair, and then I ran outside to the sidewalk and shouted at the coffee-colored pirate to bring a doctor. With a wisdom that I had not suspected in him, he left his team and set off on foot, aware of the value of speed. In ten minutes, he returned with a serious, gray-haired, capable man of medicine. With a few words (each worth much less than eight cents), I explained my presence in the empty house of mystery to him. He bowed with imposing understanding and went to the old Negro. "Uncle Caesar," he said calmly, "run to my house and tell Miss Lucy to give you a container of cream filled with fresh milk and half a glass of wine. And come back quickly. Don't drive - run. I want you to come back sometime this week." It occurred to me that Dr. Merriman also felt a distrust of the abilities of the land pirate's horses. After Uncle Caesar left, heavily but nimbly, for the road, the doctor examined me with great courtesy and careful calculation until he decided that I could do it. "It's just a case of inadequate nutrition," he said. "In other words, the result of poverty, pride, and arrogance. Miss Caswell has many devoted friends who would be happy to help her, but she will not accept anything except Uncle Caesar, who once belonged to her family." "Mr. Caswell!" I said, surprised. And then I looked at the contract and saw that it was signed "Azalea Adair Caswell." "I thought it was Miss Adair," I said. "I married a drunken, useless loafer, sir," said the doctor. "It is said that he still steals the money that her old servant contributes to her diet." When they brought the milk and wine, the doctor revived Azalea Adair. She sat up and talked about the lies of the leaves in their season and their color. He referred to her fainting spell as the culmination of an old heart palpitation. Impy burst her bubble as she lay on the couch."The doctor had to go somewhere else, and I followed him to the door. I told him that I was capable and willing to give a reasonable advance payment to Azalea Adair for future contributions to the magazine, and he seemed pleased. By the way," he said, "you might like to know they'll have a royalty on a taxi. Azalea Adair's grandfather, old Caesar, was a king in Siong. Caesar himself has royal habits, as you may have observed. As the doctor walked away, I heard Uncle Caesar's voice inside: "Did he get the two dollars from you, Miss Zelia?" "Yes, Caesar," I heard Azalea Adair reply weakly. And then I went inside and concluded the business negotiations with our financier. I took responsibility for advancing fifty dollars, making it a necessary formality to secure our agreement. Then Uncle Caesar took me back to the hotel.""The blessed one had been involved in a terrible battle - the details showed it. Although useless and despised, he was also a warrior. But he had lost. His hands were still clenched so tightly that his fingers did not open. The generous citizens who had known him stood around him and searched for their vocabulary to find some kind words, if possible, to speak of him. A kind man said, after much thought: "When 'Cas' was about fo'teen years old, he was one of the best spellers in school." While I stood there, the fingers of the right hand of the "man who was" hanging on the side of a white pine box, relaxed and dropped something at my feet. I covered it with a hoc qui- etly, and a little later I picked it up and pocketed it. I realized that in his last struggle his hand must have inadvertently grabbed this object and held it with a deadly grip. O H EN R Y - 100 S EL E CT E D S T(I R1 E S 52T At the hotel that night, the main topic of conversation, with possible exceptions of politics and prohibition, was the death of Major Caswell. I heard a man say to a group of listeners: "In my opinion, gentlemen, Castell was murdered by some of those niggers for his money. He had fifty dollars this afternoon, which he showed to various gentlemen in the hotel. When they killed him, the money was not on him." I left town the next night at nine, and as the train crossed the bridge over the Cumberland River, I took a yellow, horn, coat button the size of a fifty-cent piece, with frayed roots of thick twine hanging from it, and threw it out the window into the slow, silent waters below. I wonder what it's doing in Buffalo. LI THEItL nitE No MOxx Chrison: these are stories to write. Fiction is exhausted, and the next best thing, newspaper articles, is made by clever young journalists who have married early and have a charmingly pessimistic view of life. So, for seasonal realism, we are limited to two very dubious sources - facts and philosophy. We'll start with - whatever you choose to call it. Chilrens are small animals that we have to get through under an amazing variety of conditions. Especially when childhood sorrows overcome them, we are in a difficult position.""We are exhausting the meager reserves of comfort we have - and then we beat them, with tears, to sleep. Then we grumble within the dust of a million years and ask why. This is how we get out of the mousetrap. As for the chips-dien, no one understands them except for the old women, the hounds, and the sheepdogs. 

Now come the distant points in the case of Rap-19oll, "i atter'lc-ination," and the twenty-fifth of December. 

"At ten of the same month, the child of the millionaire lost her rag. There were many servants in the palace of the Millionaire at Hi "lson, and they stormed the house and garden, but they did not find the lost treasure. The child was a girl of her age, and one of those twisted little beasts that often hurt the sensitivity of wealthy parents, getting their affection attached to someone vulgar.""Then tell Ludovicos to take out the Mercedes and take him wherever he wants to go.""The owners of the magazine had increased his (the publisher's) salary just as he had installed a jewel from a cook who had recently been imported into his house and was afraid of the police, and the morning newspapers had published an entire speech he had delivered at a publishers' symposium. Also, the triumphant notes of a wonderful song that his charming young wife had sung to him before leaving his apartment in the center of the city that morning echoed in his mind. In recent times, he had been enthusiastically interested in her music, practicing early and carefully. When he had congratulated her on improving her voice, she hugged him joyfully for his praise. He also felt the benevolent, conical medicine of the trained nurse, Spring, gently traveling through the sick rooms of the city. While the publisher Westbrook walked among the rows of benches (that were constantly filled with vagrants and guardians of illegal childhood) in the park, he felt his sleeve being held and held. Suspecting that he was going to be begged, he turned a cold and expressionless face and saw that his captor was - Dawe - Shackelford Dawe, dirty, almost disheveled, with the noble barely visible in him through the deepest lines of the miserable.""Westbrook sent a careful and conscientious personal letter with every rejected manuscript, detailing the reasons why he considered it unavailable. Publisher Westbrook had his own view of what made a good novel. The same goes for Dawe. Mrs. Dawe was mainly interested in the ingredients of the few dishes she managed to collect. One day, Mr. Dawe had talked to her about the virtues of certain French writers. At dinner they sat with a plate that a hungry child could have finished with one spoonful. Dawe commented, "It's Maupassant's hash," said Mrs. Dawe. "It may not be art, but I wish you would make a serial of five plates for Marion Crawford and a sweet with Ella Wheeler Wilcox for dessert. I'm hungry." As far away from success as Shackleford Dawe was, when the lie pulled the sleeve of Erlitor Westbrook in Madison Square, it was the first time the editor had seen Dawe in several months. "Why, are you Shacks?" said Westbrook somewhat awkwardly, because this phrasing touched on the changed appearance of the other.""I know I can write good novels and I will make you admit it. I will make you change the spelling of "regrets" to "c-h-e-q-u-e" before I'm done with you."

The publisher, Westbrook, looked at Dawe over the top of his glasses with a sweetly mournful, all-wise, sympathetic, skeptical expression - the copyrighted expression of a besieged publisher dealing with an uncooperative author.

"Have you read the last story I sent you - 'Soul's Alarum'?" asked Dawe.

"Carefully. I had my doubts about it, Shack. Really, I did. It had some good points. I'm writing you a letter to go with it when I return it to you. Sorry."

"Never mind about the regrem," said Dawe bluntly. "That's long gone. It's as dead as mutton. What I want to know is why. Come on, now, let's have the good points."

"The story," said Westbrook deliberately, with a suppressed sigh, "is built around an almost original plot. Characterization - the best you've ever done. Construction - almost flawless, good on our side except for a few weak joints that could be strengthened with a little lubrication and some brushwork. It was a good story except -"

"I can write English, can't I?" Dawe broke in. "You've always said so."

"Well, the trouble is -"

"The same old thing," Dawe said. "You work yourself up to a crescendo as an artist. And then you turn photographer. I don't know what form of petulant madness is driving you, Shack, but that's what you're doing with what you write. No, I'll withdraw the comparison with the photographer. Now -"

and then photography, despite its impossible possibilities, strives to grab that elusive glimpse of truth. But you spoil every solution with those flat, monotonous, finger-painted daubs of yours that I have too often complained about. If you'd get to the literary top of your dramatic scenes and paint them with the high colors that art demands, the postman would be leaving fewer bulky envelopes with your name on them at your door."

"Oh, violins and spotlights!" Dawe jeered. "You still have that old saw about the sawmill drama in your head.""When the man with the black mustache kidnaps the golden-haired Bessie, you should make the mother kneel and raise her hands to the projector and say: "Let heaven be a witness that I will not rest night or day until the heartless criminal who stole my child feels the weight of a modern's revenge!'"

"The writer Westbrook admitted a srrh, that is, impenetrable self-satisfaction," he said, "I think that in real life the woman would express herself with these words or very similar ones."

"People in real life do not have heroism and empty words in emotional crises. They simply do not do it. If they speak in such circumstances, they use the same vocabulary they use every day, and they run. They make the world and their ideas a little more dormant, that's all."

"Shack," says Dr. Westlirook impressed, "have you ever picked up the battered and lifeless leg of a child from under the wheels of a car on the road, and transferred it sick to your arms and placed it in front of the disheveled mother? Have you ever heard the words of grief and despair as they flowed spontaneously from her lips?"

"Well, no," replied Editor Westbrook, with a slight furrow of his brow. "But I can imagine what she would say."

"And I could imagine the same thing," Dawe said.

"And now it was the right time for Editor Westbrook to play the oracle and silence his colleague, the strong commentator. It wasn't for an arrived fictionist to dictate the words to be uttered by the heroes and heroines of the Min a Magazine, as opposed to his publisher's theories.""My dear Sak," she said, "if I know anything about life, I know that every sudden, profound, and tragic emotion in the human heart demands a suitable, harmonious, conforming, and appropriate expression of emotion; how much of this inevitable agreement between expression and emotion should be attributed to nature and how much to the influence of art, would be difficult to say—the sublimely terrible roar of the lioness who has lost her cubs is dramatically so much above her usual grunt and whimper as the ravings and hyperboles of Lear are above the level of his dotage. But it is also true that all men and women have what can be called an unconscious dramatic sense that is awakened by a fairly deep and powerful emotion—a sense unconsciously acquired from literature and the stage—and impels them to express those emotions in a language appropriate to their importance and theatrical value."

"And in the name of the seven sacred saddles of our Sagitmri, where did the stage and literature learn it?" asked Dawe. "From life," triumphantly answered the publisher."'And again,' continued the publisher, without stopping to argue, 'when Veronica opens her husband's letter informing her that he has run off with the manicurist, her words are - let me see -'
'She says,' interrupted the author, 'Well, what do you think of that!'
'Illogical and inappropriate words,' said Westbrook, 'that present an anti-climax - plunging the story into desperate Passion. Even worse, they reflect life falsely. No human being ever uttered commonplace expressions when faced with a sudden tragedy.'
'Wrong,' said Dawe, clamping his unshaven jaws stubbornly. 'I say no man or woman ever utters big words when they reach a real climax. They talk, of course, and a little worse.'
The publisher rose from the bench with an air of indulgence and inside information.
'Tell me, Westbrook,' said Dow, pinning him to the lapel, 'would you have accepted "The Alarum of the Soul" if you believed that the actions and words of the characters were true at the points in the story we discussed?'
'It's very likely that I would have, if I believed so,' said the publisher. 'But I explained to you that I don't believe it.'
'If I could accuse you of being right?'
'Sorry, Shack, but I'm afraid I don't have time to argue further at the moment.'
'I don't want to disagree,' said Dawe. 'I want to prove to you from life itself that my opinion is correct.'
'How did you manage to talk?' asked Westbrook, surprised. 'Listen,' said the author seriously. 'I've thought of a way. It's important to me that my theory of true fiction be recognized as correct by the magazines. I fought for it for three years, and now I'm out of my last dollar, while two months' rent is owed to me.' 'I applied the opposite of your theory,' said the CDIT director, 'by choosing novels for the Minces magazine. The circle has increased from ninety thousand to four hundred thousand.' 'It should have increased to one million,' said Date. 'You said something you should regret now for denying your pet theory.' 'I'll do it. If you give me half an hour of your time, I'll prove to you that I'm right. I'll prove it with Louise.' 'Your wife!' exclaimed Westbrook.""Flow;
"Well, not exactly from her, but together with her," said l3awe. "Now, as you know, how devoted and beloved Louisa has always been. She believes that I am the only genuine product on the market that bears the signature of the old doctor. She is more beloved and faithful than ever since I was given the role of the neglected genius."

"Indeed, she is a charming and admirable life partner," agreed the publisher. "I remember how inseparable friends they used to be with Mrs. Westbrook. We are both lucky guys, Sac, to have such wives. You should bring Mrs. Dou one evening soon, and we will have one of those informal dinners that we used to enjoy so much."

"Later," said Dawe. "When I get another shirt. And now I'll tell you my plan. When I was getting ready to leave the house after breakfast - if you can call it breakfast with tea and oatmeal - Louisa told me she would be visiting her aunt on the eighty-fifth Thursday. She said she would be back home at three o'clock. She's always on time with minute precision. It's now twenty-seven minutes to three," said Westbrook, scanning his watch.

"We have enough time," said Dawe. "We'll go to my apartment right away. I'll write a note, address it to her, and leave it on the table where she'll see it as soon as she comes in through the door. You and I will be in the dining room, hidden from the doors. In that note, I'll say that I've left her forever with a relative who understands the needs of my artistic soul as she never did. When she reads it, we'll observe her actions and hear her words. Then we'll know which theory is correct - yours or mine."

"Oh, never!" exclaimed the publisher shaking his head. "That would be unforgivably harsh. I could not agree to play Mrs. Dawe's feelings in such a way."

"Hold on," said the author. "I suppose I appreciate her as much as you do. It's for her benefit and mine that I have to get a signal for my stories in some way. It won't harm Louise. She's healthy and healthy. Her heart is as strong as a ninety-eight percent clock. It will only last a minute and then I'll come out and explain it to her."""You really owe it to me to give me the opportunity, Westbrook...

Two Art experimenters left the square and rushed eastward and then southward until they reached the Gramercy neighborhood.

One or two squares north of the Park, Dawe directed the reporter eastward again and, after a short distance, entered a tall but narrow flat building, loaded with a super-exquisitely decorated façade... When the door opened, the publisher Westbrook saw, with feelings of pity, how tired and sparse the furnished rooms were...""Theo threw the disk, covered his face with his trembling hands, and shouted in a deep voice: 'Grind me, why did you give me the last "tbou" to drink from your cup; since it is a [reward tbeti let Tb more beautiful gift of Heaven, faith, soul strip, to become the 'estin b words a waiter and read''.""But we are not dealing with the wars of Mulberry Hills and Dry Docks.
